###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option.

,depression,"The moment I learned that my partner and I would lose our baby, I felt like I lost all sense of purpose.

I’d always wanted to be a dad and as soon as university was finished we decided to start trying for a baby.

It wasn’t long before the pair of us were sitting on the edge of my bed, apprehensively waiting for the results to appear on the pregnancy test.

After what felt like an eternity, ‘PREGNANT’ flashed up on the screen. My partner and I looked at each other with a combination of fear and excitement.

It was 2017, we were 22 and had been together for a year and a half. We had just graduated and felt it was the perfect time to have a baby before settling into the world of work. All in all, it seemed like everything was going right.

It was the first time in my life that I had felt complete. 

The day soon arrived when my partner and I were going to see our little baby for the first time, at our 12 week scan. We dressed up especially for it; I wore a suit and my partner wore a lovely dress. 

As we sat nervously in the waiting room at the Lancaster Royal Infirmary we shared baby name ideas. 

It was a beautiful day – up until the sonographer rolled the scanner across my partner’s stomach and eventually said, ‘I’m so sorry’.

We asked what was wrong and she explained that there was an issue with the baby’s development. 

We were escorted into a grievance room and a consultant informed us our baby had a condition called encephalocele, which is where the skull never forms properly. 

I asked whether there was any chance of survival but my fears were confirmed. Tears fell and I was completely numb. 

My partner and I sought a second opinion because we didn’t want to admit our baby was gone, but as soon as we were told we decided to accept a medical management procedure.

Witnessing my partner lose the child we had wanted so much is the most harrowing experience I have ever endured. I choke up just thinking about it. 

After the procedure, I tried to remain strong for her. She was so brave and deserved somebody to reassure her everything would be OK. 

How could I have thought rationally at the time? Our baby had been taken away and there was nothing I could do.

At the time we didn’t live together so I made it my duty to be with her as much as possible and we developed an inseparable bond. 

But I started to feel more and more depressed and couldn’t face being here any longer. I even considered taking my life. 

Even so, I refused to seek help. I didn’t want to be a burden on my loved ones, especially my partner as she was battling with her own emotions. I worried that if I told my doctor I would be locked away. 

I thought I could make the thoughts disappear in time, but after a while it became clear that this wasn’t going to happen. 

It was at this point I told my partner. I felt a weight lifted from my shoulders and she was incredibly supportive, even though she was disheartened that I had been keeping my feelings to myself. 

We both sought professional help from our doctors to help us come to terms with our loss.

Even though I was in the midst of a mental health crisis, I still now feel selfish for contemplating suicide when my partner needed me most. But how could I have thought rationally at the time? Our baby had been taken away and there was nothing I could do. 

We had a funeral service that only my partner and I attended. We scattered his ashes in the memorial garden at the crematorium. 

I’m so grateful to have had my partner and we’ve since got married and become parents to a beautiful baby boy called Noah. 

It hasn’t been easy. During pregnancy with Noah, my partner and I were incredibly cautious. While I do have fond memories of Noah kicking my hand when I’d cuddle my wife, we were so anxious throughout that we didn’t really get to fully enjoy the experience. 

At each scan we would breathe a sigh of relief that we had reached another milestone. 

When he was born I cried so hard – mostly at how proud I was of my wife and son, combined with all the emotion I had suppressed from the last pregnancy. 

It wasn’t until Noah was in my arms in the delivery room that we knew everything was going to be fine. 

I often saw how great my friends were with their children and I didn’t get the same thrill and enjoyment.

Yet I found it incredibly difficult to bond with Noah initially. I didn’t want to cuddle him or show him any affection. I didn’t feel normal. 

I was petrified of bonding with him because I felt that if I lost him it would completely end me. I became a recluse and avoided interacting with anybody; I was only content when I was sleeping. I felt empty, as if I was merely existing. 

My wife quickly realised how detached I was from reality. Often she’d be talking to me and I’d blankly stare into space, not taking in anything being said. 

I often saw how great my friends were with their children and I didn’t get the same thrill and enjoyment. I was upset as I felt surely I should be feeling the same way with my child. 

When Noah was a couple of months old, my wife convinced me to see my doctor, who concluded I was dealing with postpartum depression.

Before my diagnosis, I wasn’t even aware men could get postpartum depression. However, the doctor explained that I was normal, before prescribing me antidepressants and counselling sessions. 

In time, I gradually rebuilt my confidence and formed a bond with my beautiful and wonderful son. When we lost our first baby, it felt impossible to move forward and although I’ll never forget our first child, Noah brings that light back into my life.

He’s nearly two now and so intelligent. He has so much love to give. Noah and my wife offer my life a sense of purpose and without them, I don’t know where I’d be. Since going through this experience, I’m much more open about my emotions with friends and family. 

I vowed to my wife that when I got better I would try and help others do the same by showing them paternal postpartum depression does happen and you shouldn’t keep your feelings to yourself.

In particular, I’ve raised funds and awareness of Tigerlily Trust, a local bereavement charity that supported my wife and I during our struggle. They provide tangible symbols of remembrance for parents bereaved through miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death. We hadn’t heard of them before, so having them show us love and support in our difficult time was heartwarming.  

In time, my wife and I would love more children, but there will always be a sense of anxiety after our first experience. I’m a firm believer that time is a great healer, so for now, we are enjoying our beautiful son grow.

It was a beautiful day – up until the sonographer rolled the scanner across my partner’s stomach and eventually said, ‘I’m so sorry’.

We asked what was wrong and she explained that there was an issue with the baby’s development. 

We were escorted into a grievance room and a consultant informed us our baby had a condition called encephalocele, which is where the skull never forms properly. 

I asked whether there was any chance of survival but my fears were confirmed. Tears fell and I was completely numb. 

My partner and I sought a second opinion because we didn’t want to admit our baby was gone, but as soon as we were told we decided to accept a medical management procedure.

Witnessing my partner lose the child we had wanted so much is the most harrowing experience I have ever endured. I choke up just thinking about it. 

After the procedure, I tried to remain strong for her. She was so brave and deserved somebody to reassure her everything would be OK. 

How could I have thought rationally at the time? Our baby had been taken away and there was nothing I could do.

At the time we didn’t live together so I made it my duty to be with her as much as possible and we developed an inseparable bond. 

But I started to feel more and more depressed and couldn’t face being here any longer. I even considered taking my life. 

Even so, I refused to seek help. I didn’t want to be a burden on my loved ones, especially my partner as she was battling with her own emotions. I worried that if I told my doctor I would be locked away. 

I thought I could make the thoughts disappear in time, but after a while it became clear that this wasn’t going to happen. 

It was at this point I told my partner. I felt a weight lifted from my shoulders and she was incredibly supportive, even though she was disheartened that I had been keeping my feelings to myself. 

We both sought professional help from our doctors to help us come to terms with our loss.

Even though I was in the midst of a mental health crisis, I still now feel selfish for contemplating suicide when my partner needed me most. But how could I have thought rationally at the time? Our baby had been taken away and there was nothing I could do. 

We had a funeral service that only my partner and I attended. We scattered his ashes in the memorial garden at the crematorium. 

I’m so grateful to have had my partner and we’ve since got married and become parents to a beautiful baby boy called Noah. 

It hasn’t been easy. During pregnancy with Noah, my partner and I were incredibly cautious. While I do have fond memories of Noah kicking my hand when I’d cuddle my wife, we were so anxious throughout that we didn’t really get to fully enjoy the experience. 

At each scan we would breathe a sigh of relief that we had reached another milestone. 

When he was born I cried so hard – mostly at how proud I was of my wife and son, combined with all the emotion I had suppressed from the last pregnancy. 

It wasn’t until Noah was in my arms in the delivery room that we knew everything was going to be fine. 

I often saw how great my friends were with their children and I didn’t get the same thrill and enjoyment.

Yet I found it incredibly difficult to bond with Noah initially. I didn’t want to cuddle him or show him any affection. I didn’t feel normal. 

I was petrified of bonding with him because I felt that if I lost him it would completely end me. I became a recluse and avoided interacting with anybody; I was only content when I was sleeping. I felt empty, as if I was merely existing. 

My wife quickly realised how detached I was from reality. Often she’d be talking to me and I’d blankly stare into space, not taking in anything being said. 

I often saw how great my friends were with their children and I didn’t get the same thrill and enjoyment. I was upset as I felt surely I should be feeling the same way with my child. 

When Noah was a couple of months old, my wife convinced me to see my doctor, who concluded I was dealing with postpartum depression.

Before my diagnosis, I wasn’t even aware men could get postpartum depression. However, the doctor explained that I was normal, before prescribing me antidepressants and counselling sessions. 

In time, I gradually rebuilt my confidence and formed a bond with my beautiful and wonderful son. When we lost our first baby, it felt impossible to move forward and although I’ll never forget our first child, Noah brings that light back into my life.

He’s nearly two now and so intelligent. He has so much love to give. Noah and my wife offer my life a sense of purpose and without them, I don’t know where I’d be. Since going through this experience, I’m much more open about my emotions with friends and family. 

I vowed to my wife that when I got better I would try and help others do the same by showing them paternal postpartum depression does happen and you shouldn’t keep your feelings to yourself.

In particular, I’ve raised funds and awareness of Tigerlily Trust, a local bereavement charity that supported my wife and I during our struggle. They provide tangible symbols of remembrance for parents bereaved through miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death. We hadn’t heard of them before, so having them show us love and support in our difficult time was heartwarming.  

In time, my wife and I would love more children, but there will always be a sense of anxiety after our first experience. I’m a firm believer that time is a great healer, so for now, we are enjoying our beautiful son grow.

Parents should be looking after themselves as much as they look after their little ones each day.As a first time father, I suffered with postpartum depression and wanted to end my life"

But I really just needed to deposit some thoughts.

I'm tired of (this) life. I've got no real friends and don't really feel connected to anyone. It's always been like this and I've always been the odd one in every social group I've been. I just haven't felt sincerely understood for a while and I just can't find happiness in things anymore. I feel like a monster, I'm miserable of myself. I don't even know what I'm saying anymore at this point. Every day is just worse and worse, I just feel so humiliated and embarrassed about myself, I've got nothing and no one. I've always been an outcast, and I feel like I just wasn't supposed to be (and I actually was an accident indeed, I found out recently). This phase of my life has been going on for the past 4 years of my life and I'm tired of fighting myself and lying to myself everyday that things will get better.

I'm not stupid, I know that nobody sincerely wants to listen to my struggles, and if anything I can't blame these people, I wouldn't care about myself too if I were them. Not even professionals, who get paid daily to help you cope with these kind of things actually care about your well being at the end of the day. Nobody cares about me, it's simple, I've always been that person you go to because you're friends aren't around (or you don't even have any). And I've always been that person that you'd pick the last on the team when you're a captain of a sports game. You wouldn't notice me if were gone, in fact, you wouldn't care or even be happy, some of you have even explicitly told me that you'd wish I were gone. 

I'm not good at anything and probably won't ever be, I just don't have anything to be recognized for. I offer nothing as a person and if anything I feel like a deadly weight to the people I care about, everyday. No matter how hard I've tried, I've tried both my hardest and not at all at times. People just don't like me, no matter what I do. I dislike myself too, I'm tired of this life, I'm just tired of all of this. I'm contemplating suicide, but just haven't figured out when and where to do it. I know sooner or later I'll probably go through with it though. This pain is just stronger than any emotion I've felt in my life. Yes, I've tried meds... but if anything they made it just harder for me to naturally find joy in things.

Now I don't understand how people live life these days. Because through my eyes LITERALLY EVERYTHING IS BORING. You name it, it seem boring and pointless to me. My experience of an average day is work, eat, shit, sleep on repeat and every time I try to find some form of entertainment or in reality, a distraction, I get bored in minutes and then get a headache from not being sufficiently distracted. And every moment I have free time, I curse it because it'll come down to me thinking about how pointless everything is. Apparently I didn't come pre-installed with the standard life cycle instructions where people can fool themselves into some form of satisfaction. I would love to be able to have that mindset just to keep my self going, but every day the option of death seems more and more like the better option and I just don't have the balls to follow through yet for some reason, but I clearly don't like living. Every time I bring up my boredom to people they shoot the same answers:

\- ""**you have to find what you like to do**"" - As far as i can see I don't like anything and am living for no reason. I am sorry I can't make something up.

\-""**You gotta travel**"" - I don't like traveling and I don't see the point in traveling X amount of miles to do nothing... somewhere else.

\-""**try new things**"" - \*genius\* I wonder why I never tried that....

\- ""**You gotta work out bro!**"" - Fro me exercise is nothing but pain, I don't get the dopamine or endorphins that people claim to feel. And before anyone gives me shit, I have tried and went to the gym consistently for pretty much a year, lost weight, kept it off and still don't give a shit. Because people will defend this one till the death for some reason.

\-""**everything will make sense once you find the right girl**"" - so someone can be miserable with me? I have yet to me a human that has made me feel anything besides the feeling of nothing. the best I've seen so far is a passive person who have zero effect on my life. And my sex drive in general is just not that strong, there's something but not much.  I am sure at some point somebody will bring up testosterone or something but, I just want to point out, **This is not about me getting laid**, but I am sure this will be ignored... if anyone even reads this. Generally I see post that aren't about ""I am gonna kill myself right now!"" In the title ( I am working on it) usually get swept under the rug. And forget about reproducing, holy shit having kids seems like a fate worse than death for me and I emphasize ""**FOR ME**"" you all keep reproducing but I **PERSONALLY** can't stand kids. (incoming swarm of reproducers, I mean ""parents""  to curse me out anyway)

\-""**drugs, drugs, drugs**"" - Am I on anything? No at the moment but I am working on it. Is that really all it is? I am just missing a cocktail of pills? maybe but I doubt that will fix my general apathy and boredom issue, but if it'll make me stop wishing for death then I guess that's something.

I could probably go on but Lets see what happens. I know I sounds testy and... I am honestly. I but this mindset has been getting too much recently and I keep wanting to see if I am just missing something or I am just pretty much screwed until I muster up the balls to end it. I am sorry for wasting the time of whomever may read this.Everything is boring and pointless and nothing interests me."

,depression,"I was so depressed months ago. I stood over a bridge and all I could think about was my family. They’d be so upset if I was gone. Even if it was just for a few days, I can’t hurt my family like that so I wrote notes for them all. It would help them move on. But then I thought about my little brother. I know he would blame himself. I just can’t do it to them so I forced myself to get better. I forced myself to get a job and do well at uni and to be the best me, the me that I always wanted to be and the me that they wanted me to be. And I met someone. And he’s just so patient with me and he’s beautiful to me and for a second I did it all, I did it all for me. I forced myself to get better.

This is going to be a long one, so buckle up. Usual story, normal childhood up until 8th grade when my mom became an alcoholic. Rough experience in high school, dad has to work to support us we have to fend for ourselves. First suicide attempt was 16. Things got a bit better, until around 19. Second suicide attempt after losing a job, a gf of two years and dropping out of school. Go to the psych, clinical depression. Have trouble keeping a job and getting back to school until 22. Meet an amazing girl, maintain a job for 9 months, make plans to go back to school, gain some muscle. All is well until this past summer. Job is causing so much anxiety, just don’t show up. Gf breaks up with me (totally justified) bc I cant bring myself to do anything. It’s been 6 months. Still not over her. Lost 25 pounds of muscle in 3 months. Don’t have a job. Struggling through these semesters. All of my “friends” are graduated college, never invite me out. Don’t blame them, I’m not sad on the outside but the one’s gf never liked me and that circle always talks behind everyone’s back. Only thing I enjoy now is playing guitar and writing music, the only positive thing in my life. So, I’m 23, my friends don’t like me, my ex is done with me, I’m not going to get a bachelors for at least another two years, I’m sickly, pale, scrawny, socially inept, jobless, living at home, and depressed. I think the beginning of change has to be today or I won’t make it. I decided to delete all social media apps (group chat so no talking to friends, same with snap, instagram, Twitter, and after this Reddit.) I’ve always been hopelessly optimistic but I think life has finally burnt me out. Not sure if there is a point here. I will try. But I’m just so far behind, I already met and failed with the love of my life, drive away all my friends, am a burden to my family and society, and have no skills or talents or worth. Don’t try to cheer me up please. Just listen, understand, acknowledge, and be on your way. I do my best on my own, I always thought. But the older you get, the less that rings true. If you read, thanks for reading. I don’t know why anonymous internet users make us feel validated but I need that today. Hug your loved ones, have a beer, watch a movie, just be better than me.

,depression,"I'm a teen girl. I used to be so excited whenever my parents went away, because every so often they would leave for a few days at a time and I'd have the house to myself. My sister lives with me, but she wakes up very late and comes home at dawn every day so I'm basically alone. I am extremely introverted, always have been. The thing I used to love more than anything else was being alone with my door shut tight so I could watch YouTube, read, crochet and play computer games all day. And I'd get pumped for staying up as late as I wanted, because it takes an extremely long time for me to fall asleep and I like being able to disregard time and do things when I feel like it. But now I don’t enjoy anything, it’s all suddenly empty distractions, and it feels really awful.

Whenever my parents go, they never say a word to me and I find out later. I used to see it as a pleasant surprise. But now, when I see that they're far away (my sister set up a Life 360 for them so I can see their locations), I feel so incredibly lonely. I can't function when I'm alone and there's no pressure on me. My daily life is high-pressure because my school is competitive and I go to an academy where I do research/outside work. When I'm finally left alone and no one's pushing me, I automatically withdraw and avoid all of the responsibilities I'm used to. I just drift through the day, feeling empty, barely eating and distracting myself from everything. I get so detached. I forget about everyone else and stay in my room for days on end until they return, and then have to readjust to being a part of society. And the worst part is, when I do nothing with my time, I feel the guilt gnawing at me incessantly but I can't get the motivation to move. Even typing this is hard. And fuck it, what's the point of even writing all of this when nothing that anyone can say will ever fix how I feel?

My mom died when I was 9 years old, and I remember vividly the moment when I saw her in the coffin. That's when it kicked in, that she was dead, that someone I loved was gone forever and the world would just keep on spinning. My parents (I have a really loving step mom) are really old to have a kid who's still a teen. My dad is 62 and my mom is 57. Both of them have had shitty lives and chronic stress. Whenever I look at them, I see the image of them in coffins, exactly as realistically as the memory of my birth mom. It's scary how real it is, and I know that every second that passes I'm running out of time to spend with them. I've cried so much about it and get anxiety every time I see their faces. It's selfish for me to want them to stay alive when it's their time to go. I know both of them would welcome death, because life has always been really awful.

As a teen, it's uncommon to admit this, but my parents are like an anchor for me in the real world. I have anxiety which sometimes distorts my perception and makes me feel like no one gives a shit about me. My family often feels like the only safe haven for me, the only space where I matter and I don't just disappear. And it hurts how much they love me, unconditionally, and I feel guilty for being as inadequate of a person as I am. When I think about my parents' deaths, I think ""there go the only people who will ever love me.""

Being alone reminds me of the real world, in which everything hurts and it feels like there is really no solution.

,depression,"There has been so much pain and difficulty.

I had everything. I had a great job, was pretty, had a life and an amazing wardrobe. Everything is gone.

Grandmother and father die a year apart. Im still grieving.

Met boyfriend, happy year, surprise! you are pregnant at 37!

Get fired from job... get new job that I am unable to do because I am pregnant and everyone thinks I'm deformed. Have to leave job because customers see me and think Im disgusting.

Difficult pregnancy. Water retention, pain, disfigurement, horrible doctor and even worse delivery. Had to have a c-section. Get out of hospital with an infection that tunneled through my insides and devoured me. Doctor doesn't own up to his mistake and I end up with a horrible shaggy scar. The hospital was awful, the heat was at the maximum, I didn't have a shower in my room, my husband couldn't stay with me, I didn't see my baby until 36 hours after she was born. Had allergic reaction to anesthesia and medications.

Bring healthy baby girl home. Don't sleep. Family doesn't visit or even call. Alone all day with baby...bad thoughts begin. Im fully aware that the thoughts are there and not normal and I would never act on it, but they are there and very much alive.

Travel to home country for baby's christening, my uncle dies.

Start having nightmares about someone trying to kidnap baby or even worse...

Im having a panic attack. Boyfriend is sitting in the couch in his underwear and while scratching his balls says ""we should get married"". That's my proposal memory. Lovely! Fucking lovely!

Wedding day: baby brought the stomach bug from daycare. We are sick - like really sick. Everything is coming out from everywhere. Say ""I do"" and leave our own wedding. Left everyone there to have fun and we went to the hotel we had reserved. While my husband slept, I sat in the shower, with my beautiful hair and makeup ruined crying until I just passed out. The 4 people who were staying with us got sick too.

Buy house. Lost job. Start a small resell business. Get a part time because I cant find employment

A year later husband gets downsized, and I have to move my mom to live with us to help us with the baby.

I get a silly retail job because we have no money. Husband spends 6 months at home looking for work. Finds a job that sucks, but Im still in retail.

My mother begins to make me feel inadequate because I am sad. She is embarrassed by me.

Im sad all the time. Cant handle it. Cant get out of bed. Go see Doctor - diagnose: depression and anxiety. Even with meds Im not better.

Find better job. Husband loses job. We have to sell the house that I spent so much time decorating and making it a home. I have to sell the house where my baby grew up. The only home she has known. She misses the house and tells me every night. 

Get new Doctor - get new diagnosis - bipolar 2. Well... this sucks! New meds. Mother still ashamed of me. Reminds me everyday how Im an inadequate mother.

Start seeing therapist. The only person that has actually acknowledged that I have been through a lot and that it sucks that the moments of life that are supposed to be joyful have always been tarnished by something I cant control.

I get better job.

Sell house and move to a small apartment. Have to sell or donate EVERYTHING we own. We need the money and we don't have the space. So many items that I personally refinished and collected through the 4 years we lived in the house. I miss all of them.

Husband is still out of work. Keeps applying, but no interviews.... can't get a job.

Don't know how Im going to pay for anything. Mu husband becomes a vegan. Do you know how expensive it is to be a vegan?!

How will I pay next month's rent? Ask family for help. This is an inconvenience and we cant help you

&lt;p&gt;Wedding day: baby brought the stomach bug from daycare. We are sick - like really sick. Everything is coming out from everywhere. Say &amp;quot;I do&amp;quot; and leave our own wedding.

&lt;p&gt;Buy house. Lost job. Start a small resell business. Get a part time because I cant find employment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year later husband gets downsized, and I have to move my mom to live with us to help us with the baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get a silly retail job because we have no money. Husband spends 6 months at home looking for work. Finds a job that sucks, but Im still in retail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother begins to make me feel inadequate because I am sad. She is embarrassed by me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im sad all the time. Cant handle it. Cant get out of bed. Go see Doctor - diagnose: depression and anxiety. Even with meds Im not better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find better job. Husband loses job. We have to sell the house that I spent so much time decorating and making it a home. I have to sell the house where my baby grew up. The only home she has known. She misses the house and tells me every night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get new Doctor - get new diagnosis - bipolar 2. Well... this sucks! New meds. Mother still ashamed of me. Reminds me everyday how Im an inadequate mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start seeing therapist. The only person that has actually acknowledged that I have been through a lot and that it sucks that the moments of life that are supposed to be joyful have always been tarnished by something I cant control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Husband is still out of work. Keeps applying, but no interviews.... can&amp;#39;t get a job.&lt;/p&gt;

Now I don't understand how people live life these days. Because through my eyes LITERALLY EVERYTHING IS BORING. You name it, it seem boring and pointless to me. My experience of an average day is work, eat, shit, sleep on repeat and every time I try to find some form of entertainment or in reality, a distraction, I get bored in minutes and then get a headache from not being sufficiently distracted. And every moment I have free time, I curse it because it'll come down to me thinking about how pointless everything is. Apparently I didn't come pre-installed with the standard life cycle instructions where people can fool themselves into some form of satisfaction. I would love to be able to have that mindset just to keep my self going, but every day the option of death seems more and more like the better option and I just don't have the balls to follow through yet for some reason, but I clearly don't like living. Every time I bring up my boredom to people they shoot the same answers:

\- ""**you have to find what you like to do**"" - As far as i can see I don't like anything and am living for no reason. I am sorry I can't make something up.

\-""**You gotta travel**"" - I don't like traveling and I don't see the point in traveling X amount of miles to do nothing... somewhere else.

\-""**try new things**"" - \*genius\* I wonder why I never tried that....

\- ""**You gotta work out bro!**"" - Fro me exercise is nothing but pain, I don't get the dopamine or endorphins that people claim to feel. And before anyone gives me shit, I have tried and went to the gym consistently for pretty much a year, lost weight, kept it off and still don't give a shit. Because people will defend this one till the death for some reason.

\-""**everything will make sense once you find the right girl**"" - so someone can be miserable with me? I have yet to me a human that has made me feel anything besides the feeling of nothing. the best I've seen so far is a passive person who have zero effect on my life. And my sex drive in general is just not that strong, there's something but not much.  I am sure at some point somebody will bring up testosterone or something but, I just want to point out, **This is not about me getting laid**, but I am sure this will be ignored... if anyone even reads this. Generally I see post that aren't about ""I am gonna kill myself right now!"" In the title ( I am working on it) usually get swept under the rug. And forget about reproducing, holy shit having kids seems like a fate worse than death for me and I emphasize ""**FOR ME**"" you all keep reproducing but I P**ERSONALLY** can't stand kids. (incoming swarm of reproducers, I mean ""parents""  to curse me out anyway)

\-""**drugs, drugs, drugs**"" - Am I on anything? No at the moment but I am working on it. Is that really all it is? I am just missing a cocktail of pills? maybe but I doubt that will fix my general apathy and boredom issue, but if it'll make me stop wishing for death then I guess that's something.

,depression,"I am buried by my thoughts. Trapped in my own mind and I cannot escape. Filled with sadness, but not depression. Feeling like I have no purpose but no reason to die. I do not want to die, I want to live, but for what reason? 

It seems that everything I attempt to do, I fail. My lack of foresight triggers my anxiety like no other. I am so lost in my life. I feel like there’s nothing more for me to do. I have already proved to society that I do not benefit anyone. My presence is unnecessary, life goes on. 
I search for happiness with no result. No matter how hard I try, I am always discouraged and feel like that is nothing I can do to better myself. 

I’m very ugly inside and out. There is nothing good about me. Everything I do is for others. I do not care about myself at all. I’d rather make someone else happy than make myself happy. I always put others before me and I feel so unappreciated. I’m inferior, everyone is better than me. 

I feel like I’ve lost contact with my soul. I don’t even know who I am anymore. I’m completely institutionalized. Go to school, come home and do homework and do nothing with myself the rest of the day. Rinse and repeat. 

I’m traumatized by my past. I decided in December 2019 that I should off myself. I overdosed on aspirin and took 100 pills, 32,500 mg. It was past the lethal amount. I assumed I wouldn’t wake up the next day and that night was the end of me. The ringing in my ears became so loud after I took the pills that I couldn’t even think. I thought, this is it. The next morning, I woke up, in incredible pain. I said, maybe tomorrow I won’t wake up. So I endured the pain for the rest of the day. Woke up again, hoping the next morning I won’t wake up. I was wrong, the next morning I woke up in the ICU with extensive kidney damage and hearing loss. I thought, I’m not destined to die yet. I couldn’t believe what I had done to myself and that I needed to change. 

Current day, I am no longer depressed but I am not happy. I am empty. I don’t know what to do with my free time and I cannot dispose of my thoughts. I try to escape from my thoughts with drugs and sex but I still feel so incomplete. I feel like a chunk of me has been missing since I overdosed. I feel like I don’t even have a personality anymore. 

I am very sensitive and the smallest things can make me cry. I have always been like that, I’m vulnerable. I feel like my soul is long gone and I can’t retrieve it.

I turn 25 in 2 days and I feel like my life might as well be fucking over. I went a year without even the slightest hint of a shot at meeting a girl. At this rate I’m 100% going to die aloneI have no chance. No hope. I hate this shit so much"

,depression,"I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can't lose weight no matter how hard I try.   I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. 

I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. 

I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.

I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but been unable to. 

Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.

I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. 

I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. 

I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars then needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. 

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later..

I just literally can't take anymore of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum.

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later..

I just literally can't take anymore of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum. I am just so tired of fighting and so tired of going through life like this barely being able to breath and barely being able to survive and have absolutely nothing to show for it.Maybe its for the best that I don't live anymore, women don't want me, no family, no friends."

I don’t even know anymore.

This post might aound superficial but it really js a common theme in my life, other people seem better and more deserving and get what they want.

So i made a post a while ago about a female collegue and I that liked the same guy at work. He is not a direct collegue but comes by at work to hang up flyers. He is in the music industry and does some promotion on the side. 
So my female collegue is really pretty and sexy.  A lot of guys like her and fall in love with her or like her for sex, in both ways she is very popular. Also she is bisexual and open about sex and while she is kind of perfect because she is very pretty and sexy, she also has a kind of girl next door look and vulnerability (some mental issues) that ironically make her even more appealing.

The only annoying part about her is that she talks a lot about her self and her dates and her 'guys'. Even on my birthday she forgot it was my birthday but talked endlessly about the date she had last night. She seems to like to be the centre of attention, and if she isn't she will say or behave in a certain way that does maker her the centre of attention.

So we like the same guy that comes to work once every week. A few months ago she almost wanted to ask the him out but then suddenly met someone else, a friend of a friend. They got into a relationship for a while. At that moment i thought i might as well give it a go and asked the guy out that we both liked. He turned me down and told me he had a girlfriend.  At that moment i felt like this wasn't true and he just wasn't into me. I was a bit dissapointed of course to be rejected.

My female collegue now broke it off this week with her boyfriend. As much as she was crazy in love and into him and had to hear stories about them being in love, now she is suddenly over him  And now she and the guy from work that i also like are going to DATE.!!! He asked her out so that means he doesn't have a girlfriend and prefers my collegue over me😥

,depression,"Well, I was diagnosed with depression in December 2018, I was prescribed Lexapro, except I can't afford it, so I get Connect instead (which is a generic copy of Lexapro), for a year I've been really shitty, almost like I was able to deal with everything before because, well, *I wasn't depressed, I didn't have it so bad*, or at least that's what I told myself, until the diagnosis which really threw me to the floor...

There have been a couple of hotspots of hope here and there, some days I don not want to kill myself, some days I do, but I mostly just want to *cease* to exist, to be free you know?

One such hotspot of hope, and the reason I really want to vent today, was a girl I had been connecting with at uni, for about 6 months now, we've become very close friends, but as one is wont to do I developed feelings for that girl, she seemed to reciprocate my advances, letting me hug her and she hugging back, she sitting next to me in class, playing with my hair and sometimes bringing me food.

She invited me today to an event to an amusement park, where we paid around $20 for 6 hours of unlimited passes to any game we wanted to go, I was really looking forward to it, but lo and behold when I got there she was with her boyfriend whom I've never even heard of before.

Of course, I was crushed, I *am* crushed, I feel... empty, odd... I dunno... almost betrayed? But deep down I know I wasn't betrayed, we never dated or got serious (she said ""te quiero"" a lot to me, if you know Spanish you know it's a very wholesome ""I love you"" but it does not necessarily imply romantic love)

I don't know how I feel, just... down... I called it quits after three hours there, I just couldn't handle seeing them together, the jealousy just got the better of me.

And I feel very guilty for posting this here, I don't even know if this is a proper place to post this, but I just want to hear some advice, some help, right now I just want to get *DRUNK*, I am trying to talk to some buddies to get a drink, I want to be *numb*, I want to be *stupid* and enjoy bliss in ignorance, or at least to feign ignorance. I feel like shit, and I know this is gonna trigger a very bad episode of just plain old depression, the kind where you just want to stay in bed and do nothing, because nothing seems to be worth doing, I've been getting those a lot, the last thing I needed was this, but such is life huh? Sometimes it just guts you right there and then and you are just left *there*. *Alone.*

I don't want to be alone, I don't want to feel so worthless, I don't want to be the piece of shit that I feel I am. I want to be better, but I don't know *how!* I just don't know! And I've been trying, and trying and trying hard and nothing seems to work, and everything I do seems to be going to shit, I don't even know how the fuck did I get where I am at uni, I am four courses away from passing all the necessary courses for graduation and yet, I feel I do not belong where I am, I feel like I am a living lie, I feel so incredibly stupid whenever I take a test, I don't know how I keep getting passing grades. I know no one is willing to hire me, as I've been trying for about a year now to get a job, even trying to talk to my contacts to see if they can put in a word for me, but I never get an interview. You know, I feel like I am going nowhere, I feel like a terrible weight to my mother, and I feel a lot like my father, who is also an unemployed POS, I really dislike my father, and yet I feel like everyday I am becoming more like him, just an angry, envious, jealous (he always shouted at my mother accusing her of cheating), I feel like I can't control myself. I look at the mirror, and I don't see myself, I see him, and I just don't want to be him, I'd rather pick up trash in the street to at least hold a job, and somehow I feel that's insulting to the people whose job it is to pick up trash.

I take care of three little quails, their names are Leonarda, Yang and Marianelo, two females and a male respectively, and when I pick them up and I feel their warmth, it's almost the only thing that makes me not want to quit just yet, but in the end they are just silly birds, and I say silly in the most loving way possible, but they just like to run free and very rarely come to me.

I don't guys, I am losing it, some days are bad... some days are... some days are like today. I am losing control, I just want to let it off my chest, I just want to be heard and I can't find anywhere else to throw my voice, this is just a hail mary, I don't know what I am doing, I just want to feel better, I just want it all to end.

I don't want to be alone, I don't want to feel so worthless, I don't want to be the piece of shit that I feel I am. I want to be better, but I don't know *how!* I just don't know! And I've been trying, and trying and trying hard and nothing seems to work, and everything I do seems to be going to shit, I don't even know how the fuck did I get where I am at uni, I am four courses away from passing all the necessary courses for graduation and yet, I feel I do not belong where I am, I feel like I am a living lie, I feel so incredibly stupid whenever I take a test, I don't know how I keep getting passing grades. I know no one is willing to hire me, as I've been trying for about a year now to get a job, even trying to talk to my contacts to see if they can put in a word for me, but I never get an interview. You know, I feel like I am going nowhere, I feel like a terrible weight to my mother, and I feel a lot like my father, who is also an unemployed POS, I really dislike my father, and yet I feel like everyday I am becoming more like him, just an angry, envious, jealous (he always shouted at my mother accusing her of cheating), I feel like I can't control myself. I look at the mirror, and I don't see myself, I see him, and I just don't want to be him, I'd rather pick up trash in the street to at least hold a job, and somehow I feel that's insulting to the people whose job it is to pick up trash.

I take care of three little quails, their names are Leonarda, Yang and Marianelo, two females and a male respectively, and when I pick them up and I feel their warmth, it's almost the only thing that makes me not want to quit just yet, but in the end they are just silly birds, and I say silly in the most loving way possible, but they just like to run free and very rarely come to me.

I don't guys, I am losing it, some days are bad... some days are... some days are like today. I am losing control, I just want to let it off my chest, I just want to be heard and I can't find anywhere else to throw my voice, this is just a hail mary, I don't know what I am doing, I just want to feel better, I just want it all to end.

I am sorry for the long post, I am sorry for the broken english, I am sorry for everything, I don't know anymore, I am just sorry.I need to vent a little bit"

,depression,"I started coping with depression unhealthy when I was 18, turning to hard drugs, spent almost every waking moment of the last few years doing drugs. Before then I dropped out of school at 15, became a severe shut-in, had no motivation or will to do anything at all. The drugs gave me a reason to live, for more drugs, but I still had no motivation or will to do anything outside of drugs unless it'd get me more drugs. I started selling drugs, it started out as selling weed to get by you know? But the real money wasn't in weed, it was in MDMA. Coke. Heroin, fent, LSD. I started dealing hard to the point I was selling heroin to my mom and grandma so I could get high as fuck and forget about it all, seriously scummy shit and that's only the tip of the iceberg of the bad choices I've made the last few years to deal with this state of mind... 

I'm tired of being a scumbag, I've come to understand this feeling (and lack thereof feeling generally) quite well. I think ultimately, being depressed isn't that bad compared to the alternative for some. You may think right now you're the biggest piece of shit due to your mind telling you so but I tell you the biggest pieces of shit? It's the ones who can commit the worst of grime and let it go straight off them, that's how I've spent the last few years, in a megalomaniac and narcissistic stir.

It's not in my nature it's not in my heart. I'm a bitter woman. My husband always tells me that I ""talk down to people."" I don't talk down to people I speak in facts and truths, no one wants to hear it, and Im always the bitch. So fine no one likes me not even my family I'm the black sheep. I've been trying for years and years to fit in but now I'm asking myself why? I don't believe what they believe I  have lived a different life from them so I don't need to be like them. I've been struggling with a severe mental illness for over half my life and things went downhill fast when I got pregnant with my son and I have never recovered. I'm a lost cause and there is no hope for me. I'm here for my kids but I just don't know that it's enough anymore. No one really cares at the end of the day. I'm just some ""stuck up bitch who thinks I'm better than everyone else."" And yes that is a direct quote from my husband! He sounds so nice right?!So I realized today that I am so broken I can't be fixed"

,depression,"Hello, new here.

I've tried to keep this as short as i can but it's quite long... i would also normally do a second draft but i don't feel like reading this again so i hope it's ok.

There are two major things in my life that lead me here. To start, I was neglected by my parents. they where never mean, they didn't let me go hungry, they didn't ignore me, in fact i'm still living with them,  they just never pushed me to do anything... ever. When I was 12 they pulled me out of school to move to another state and simply never put me back in school. my dad tried homeschooling me for a month or two but quickly gave up.

Because of this I grew up very shy of other people and never had much luck making friends. I spent my teens mostly in my room playing games, watching movies and not much else. I was very isolated. I can't decide how much blame to level against myself for this. How much should a 15 year old be blamed for not enrolling himself in high school, especially when it doesn't seem to matter to anyone around him?

Similarly they never pushed me to get a job and so i just... never did.I did go to film school (which is a whole, long, sad, depressing story in and of it's self) but nothing came of it. I also spent a few months looking for work but didn't get so much as an email back from anyone. I guess it's not hard to see why when you, an employer, are looking at a 28 year old with no work experience...

About the only good thing that came out of this was meeting my long time boyfriend which leads me to the second major thing. I met him on line when i was 17 and we've been together for about a decade now. long distance relationships are hard, but it's even harder to sustain one for so long. I love him more than anything and love being around him. Every year one of us goes to visit the other for a few months and they have been some of the happiest times in my life. that being said there have been some extremely hard times, not the least of which was when he cheated on me.

he's always bee very sexual so I suppose I should have known what I was getting myself into. We had a semi open relationship. it wasn't my idea and after years of arguing we came to a compromise. blowjobs only. it upset me but seemed almost necessary. we only see each other once a year, we where both young and horny (one of us hornier than the other) and it seemed like a fair compromise to let him explore with other people since he couldn't do it with me.

He started becoming infatuated with one of his friends. he told me over and over again that it was nothing serious. i really believe he thought that because one day he came to me, told me that I was right and said he was backing off and told his friend to do this same. about a year later he cheated on me with him multiple times. he broke our rule which he knew i was already not a fan of.

what you need to understand is, the last two paragraphs take place over years. when ever he would go out with his friends i was always left alone to wonder what he's doing with them. it was constant torture and that's before he cheated on me, and he knew that. it didn't help anything that he was surrounded by people to play around with but I wasn't. I only had him. I'm 28 and have only ever been with four people including him. the other three where out of desperation. A way to back at/keep up with him and the only way to, at least in some part, blow off some of that frustration and anger. because of that, it was always awkward and I only saw one of them more than once. I really started to grow to hate sex.

when he cheated on me it destroyed me. it was the lowest moment in my life. No one to talk to, no real friends, no guidance, nothing. We spent months trying to patch things up. I still loved him and cared about him and didn't want to be without him so... i decided to open the relationship entirely. My only rule was to use a condom (Which he hadn't been). I feel like a door mat... he cheated on me and i rewarded him by not only letting him keep hanging out with the guy (who he says is his best friend) but also let him keep sleeping with him. whenever i was out of contact with him because he was out with his friends my depression and jealousy was crippling. I tore my room apart, was always angry, and was just generally out of control of my own brain.

I even tried to see a shrink during this time who ignored the things i wanted to talk about, didn't seem to care at all about this mess, kept fucking up my billing and forgetting to schedule appointments.

The time of year came when we would see each other and it was decided i would go to him this time. he thought if I met the guy that i wouldn't feel so bad. I spent three months there. it was incredibly awkward with his friends and especially that guy. the trip was very stressful. His so called ""best friend"" was a huge dick and constantly made a problem of himself to the point of even my boyfriend losing it on multiple occasions. After the whole mess my boyfriend said he really doesn't blame me for hating him.

despite that, our relationship got back on track. we where doing really well. this was going to be the first year we spent Christmas together. I went there in the summer, then a few months later he came here for Christmas. in between, he put the open part of our relationship on hold which made me really happy.

but now Christmas is over and he's gone back home and we're not sure when we'll see each other again. we're trying to get married but international marriage is difficult and we're currently at a loss. it's always hard when we separate after months together but this time has been much harder. we don't know when we'll see each other again, both of us are very stressed out trying to bring our lives together while also trying to support ourselves individually and, for me, on top of it is the memory of the place i was in last year and i feel myself sliding back to the anger and jealousy. I know it's only a matter of time before he starts fooling around again and i know he's already trying to open the possibility with more of his friends.

I don't know how to handle this anymore. i'm tired of only having myself to talk to. i'm tired of feeling walked on. i'm tired of feeling like, even if i wanted to, i don't have the life or personality that would let me participate in this openness.

I really do love him and i know he really loves me. When we're together we're inseparable and do EVERYTHING together. but when we're apart it's like i become less important to his life... maybe it's just his defense mechanism for dealing with the distance but when we separate all i want to do is cling to him, he seems to pull away and it's a lot of work to keep things together.

So, my situation is, i'm 28, living with my parents, never had a job, have no life skills and very little social skills. I'm in a long distance relationship with someone i love more than anything but he cheated on me and is now back home with his friends who, any one of them could be the next person. I have no friends and my parents (who neglected me) are really my only family. i'm depressed, angry, scared and above all, I can't even motivate myself to do the things i know i need to do. feel completely useless and broken.

I was laying in bed last night with all of this running through my head (remembering of course that even all this is only a small part of the story. their's definitely more.) and the thought sincerely occurred to me, ""what if i just fucking killed myself."". I'm not there yet and am trying to fight those thoughts but i feel myself being pulled back down into that pit i was in last year and i'm so scared of winding up there again and what if this time i fall even further?

I tore my room apart, was always angry, and was just generally out of control of my own brain.

I even tried to see a shrink during this time who ignored the things i wanted to talk about, didn't seem to care at all about this mess, kept fucking up my billing and forgetting to schedule appointments.

The time of year came when we would see each other and it was decided i would go to him this time. he thought if I met the guy that i wouldn't feel so bad. I spent three months there. it was incredibly awkward with his friends and especially that guy. the trip was very stressful. His so called ""best friend"" was a huge dick and constantly made a problem of himself to the point of even my boyfriend losing it on multiple occasions. After the whole mess my boyfriend said he really doesn't blame me for hating him.

despite that, our relationship got back on track. we where doing really well. this was going to be the first year we spent Christmas together. I went there in the summer, then a few months later he came here for Christmas. in between, he put the open part of our relationship on hold which made me really happy.

but now Christmas is over and he's gone back home and we're not sure when we'll see each other again. we're trying to get married but international marriage is difficult and we're currently at a loss. it's always hard when we separate after months together but this time has been much harder. we don't know when we'll see each other again, both of us are very stressed out trying to bring our lives together while also trying to support ourselves individually and, for me, on top of it is the memory of the place i was in last year and i feel myself sliding back to the anger and jealousy. I know it's only a matter of time before he starts fooling around again and i know he's already trying to open the possibility with more of his friends.

I don't know how to handle this anymore. i'm tired of only having myself to talk to. i'm tired of feeling walked on. i'm tired of feeling like, even if i wanted to, i don't have the life or personality that would let me participate in this openness.

I really do love him and i know he really loves me. When we're together we're inseparable and do EVERYTHING together. but when we're apart it's like i become less important to his life... maybe it's just his defense mechanism for dealing with the distance but when we separate all i want to do is cling to him, he seems to pull away and it's a lot of work to keep things together.

So, my situation is, i'm 28, living with my parents, never had a job, have no life skills and very little social skills. I'm in a long distance relationship with someone i love more than anything but he cheated on me and is now back home with his friends who, any one of them could be the next person. I have no friends and my parents (who neglected me) are really my only family. i'm depressed, angry, scared and above all, I can't even motivate myself to do the things i know i need to do. feel completely useless and broken.

I was laying in bed last night with all of this running through my head (remembering of course that even all this is only a small part of the story. their's definitely more.) and the thought sincerely occurred to me, ""what if i just fucking killed myself."". I'm not there yet and am trying to fight those thoughts but i feel myself being pulled back down into that pit i was in last year and i'm so scared of winding up there again and what if this time i fall even further? I don't know what to do.Depressed, alone, might be in the dumbest life situation possible and have been having suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life. (sorry if post is too long)"

,depression,"On occasion I feel sad. 

There's this overwhelming and pervasive sense of guilt and regret that lay atop me like a warm blanket I've just taken out of the dryer. I understand what I've done, and I've done it all to myself. 

To me it doesn't feel like these nasty thoughts I'm having are undeserved. People say: ""you've done great things"" ""you're not insane"" ""you need only take a break.""

But despite what they may say, I KNOW that they must feel different. I can see through their petty attempts to emotionally console me and compliment me with the sole purpose of making me feel better. When you see a man dying you don't turn the knife in his chest, you give him anasthesia to make his death mean less. 

It's been about a year now that I've felt this way. I can still remember those moments when I watched my phone ring until it stopped, those times I ordered food rather than leaving my room, the people I pushed away, the trust that I betrayed. And I know that there's much more I don't remember.

Everytime I consider getting better, becoming that glowing example of who I know I can be, I think of all those atrocities which I have committed and I cower before the challenge of facing the consequences.

Yet, I haven't killed myself. 

I havent killed myself. 

I wonder why that is, it's clearly a way out. Is it curiosity? Is it biology? Psychology? Sociology? What does science have to say about the fact that I've not offed myself yet?

I dont know, I havent checked. 

I think a big reason I'm still alive is because I can just go to sleep instead of dying. I think my persistence is extended by the fact that sleep is like a temporary state of nonexistence. 

I keep wondering if dying is like falling asleep. 

Would I be awake for the moment I die like in the movies, or would I fall asleep and maybe even dream before I died? Would my last thought be a tear-filled ""Finally"" or a fear filled attempt to survive? 

These are a few of the thoughts that plague my attention-seeking, way too feely, overly dramatic, obviously faking it, mind. 

I dont know how to help others see the severity. It probably seems like serenity. All I do is sleep, eat, shit, sleep some more, and occasionally I'll even lift myself up enough to get out of bed just to get high and go out with friends. 

My existence should be the easiest in all of human history. I have all my needs met, my survival is barely a question. I dont understand it, why is it when I have everything I need that I dont want it? 

It's ironic. I have more than my ancestors dreamed of, I see rocket ships fly off to space, I hold the answer to most of my questions in my pocket, hell I have all I need and I still want more.

Are we doomed to live forever wanting for the things we cannot have? Doomed to never appreciate that which we already have? Nothing good ever lasts. Why the hell is that? 

I think we're wanting creatures. I always want more, more, more, and just when I think I have enough, I need more just to keep my spirits up. 

The girls who like me are never enough, the things I accomplish are never enough, the possessions I have are never enough, the high I feel is never enough, the life I live is never enough. 

Well I think I've had enough. I think we spend our young lives running after the best this and the best that, the hottest this and the cutest that, the highest high and the sweetest ass. 

I think settling down is just that. I think its realizing that your own expectations of life are unrealistic and that life is much harder than you had previously imagined.

,depression,"I should write this in a journal, but I've found that dwelling too long is hard, and typing is a much faster mode of writing things out. So you do not need to read. Most of it is incomprehensible and incomplete anyway.

My therapist said today that when there is something I need to do that I tend to turn towards denial, until it is very close to a deadline and I end up putting myself into an anxious, depressed spiral.  We made a plan for what I was going to do for the rest of the day and I've failed to follow through, which exasperates the spiral.

I can't really talk to my friends, except one. But I don't feel like talking to them anyway. I'm just in bed, watching videos, pretending that I am doing something. I feel fat, I feel tired by my own tiredness from sleeping, I feel hungry though there are dishes that I need to do before I can eat. It occurred to me a while ago that I am not really experiencing depression, but this is the only sub I can think of.  I'm self-sabotaging, and if I stopped I wouldn't be feeling this. I would feel okay. But I do this to myself. I want to spiral to bottom. Not really, of course. I want to cut myself in a visible spot, but that would make me feel like I am becoming unstable again. I want someone to hear my scream, but I also don't want them to run away. And even if they did, and if I was okay with it, I will be entering the workforce soon. I can't let myself spiral like this. But it's the easiest thing to do. And I like easy.

,depression,"I have fought this fucking disease since I was a child, apparently born with it, as m symptoms started cropping up during elementary school. I also was diagnosed PTSD, Autism, ADHD, anxiety, and paranoia disorders. I have just reached twenty and yet feel like my life is over.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have no parents, no family, NO ONE. One of them died when I was in elementary school. My parent tried to shoot themselves in the face in front of me, neglected me, and threw fits of rage early in my childhood. The other abandoned me at birth but I was never put into the ""system"" and tossed from place to place, grew up in a rural hellhole that is rife with crime and poverty, no home. 

&amp;#x200B;

All I have left is one of my grandparents, as I watched the other one die, and I weep constantly at the thought of my grandmother dying too. Because I know it is inevitable. Life is cruel.

Nature is not fair. Humans as a species have overcame so many barriers as a species to evolve, yet we create these meaningless societal institutions constructs that create even more unnecessary struggle. All my life I was told my goal was to be good in school, to be smart, to land a good job, and I would make it.

I had no idea that I would be raped as a teenager. I had no idea that I would be molested by doctors and that would create a lifetime of PTSD. I had no idea my first two partners would abuse me.

I remember not finishing some student council powerpoint in my last month of high school. I didn't go to school my last month, as I was borderline suicidal. I remember a teacher getting up in my face and telling me how I didn't deserve to be a leader, how disappointed people should be in me. She had marked me down for months despite me scoring a perfect on the AP exam, because she preferred my sister in a foster home above me, and knew I was terrified of her.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 Another teacher was great friends with the guy who molested me and gave me straight 0s for missing school because my PTSD had become unbearable. The principal told me I should give up my ""dream universities"" and settle for a local tech school that didnt have my program. It was not fair. They didn't realize what I went through at home, or my lack of one.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It's been 3 years, and the people I graduated with are in junior year of university, I am so behind. I managed to go to a somewhat good private school later on with scholarship, but I hate it here. I was borderline molested by another doctor who pushed me around and touched me innapropriately, my PTSD is so bad to the point where I can't breathe if I hear anything medical related.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 My school's organization is a mess and many people fail. I keep having to withdraw from classes cause my disability accomodations were denied. People are rude and catty. I sit in my room and have severe paranoia and panic attacks till I sob and shake with pure agony. My psychiatrist doesn't believe how bad I am. It is unfair.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After being in 2 abusive relationships I met a guy online and things were going fine for a bit. We visited each other in different countries. Then when my PTSD got bad he started calling me a special snowflake, saying I was horrible, a drama queen, mentally unwell and ill, must have been exaggerating my abuse, etc. Ruined my self esteem. I am visiting and in bed with him right now and he is so sweet and kind, yet I remember his cruel words. I truly do not feel loved by anyone in this world.

,depression,"I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care.

,depression,"About a year ago I got out of a 5ish month relationship with a girl who I fell in love with. I thought everything I went through was just normal relationship shit, turns out she has BPD which is actually insanely hard to deal with. The best part of my life became the worst part of my life with the worst depression I have ever had when she just stopped talking to me all together out of the blue, and at the time we were in the same class every morning, so needless to say it was annihilating me from the inside out for about a month, until she all the sudden wanted me back. This happened 2 times until I just said fuck it the last time and blocked her on everything, graduated high school and havent talked to her since.

,depression,"Hello, I will try to simplify this post but it could be long. I created this account in fear that my friends know my other reddit account and sees this post there.

I am a 19 years old, and currently in college. I don't have much friends so I find it difficult to confide to anyone, and my parents used to be very strict and I usually perform well academically so I prefer not to let them down. So here I am here. I want to change myself for the better and I want to learn to care for myself (pursuing what my clear-headed self wants, not following my impulses to play video games, etc.).

When people ask me what I enjoy doing, I immediately say maths. I tried very hard in learning maths since 2 and a half years ago, and the context is that I was preparing for a ""high-level"" math exam. Thinking back to the time, I don't know if I tried so hard because I found maths fun, or because I just wanted to prove that I can achieve something impressive. Another thing is since 11th grade I started to lose friends and I truthfully don't know why I lose friends, but it could be because I am too scared at making conversations. So in 11th and 12th grade I tried instead very hard in learning even more math, doing both the IB higher level and Further level Maths. Of course, during that time I spent my free time not revising and doing math in doing my own stuff such as watching animate, playing games, etc.

However, I always try to take the hardest course in maths, so truthfully a part of me realizes that I do maths not because I like math, but I have some sort of ego and I want to prove to people around me that I am better than a great majority of the population (99.9%).

Now, I reach the point where I took way too much challenging classes in university, and it is almost finals and I find myself playing Minecraft and failing to control myself. Sometimes people ask me if I want to do something or have something to do, and I say ""I am busy"". Then, I say to myself ""I should probably use that time revising"" but end up playing minecraft (or another game but I believe they are still the same idea). I thought I liked maths, so I am supposed to find it as fun doing maths as playing minecraft, but my subconsciousness just push me to play minecraft rather than do maths, and I play several hours without stop, even if I initially allocate a small amount of time on it.

Something tells me that maybe to me, minecraft is like an alternative world where I basically can use my creativity to live a new life making a redstone farm etc., and that I pretty much am trying escaping reality by this method?

So, here is 2 questions I want to solve, and I want to ask if anyone can guide me to solving it:

1. Why don't I understand myself? How do I know if I really enjoy maths as itself? I am so confused even after 2 years of learning a load of maths.
2. What do I want in life? of course I want to feel happiness, but truthfully the only thing I know I want is recognition and for others to love me, and this I am sure I want. I just know this because my whole heart feels happy when I get recognition. Other than that, I really am not sure what I want long-term. Many times I imagine myself mastering all the math concepts and become some math genius, and people recognize me for my hard work and achievements. Another thing I want to say is I am sure I want to love doing math, but what if I don't love math in reality? It feels like many of my hobbies (piano, chess, math) are actually because I was forced or driven to do them in the past, but I don't even like them in reality, because I'd rather play something like Minecraft...

I think this post is also asking for people to recognize me, I don't know, but I think I am too lazy to reflect myself, or I don't know how to. I think it may also be because I want to have a conversation on my own problems.

PS: I really wish I can find something I enjoy doing not because I want recognition for it, but I just like that hobby for what it is.

I created this account in fear that my friends know my other reddit account and sees this post there.

I am a 19 years old, and currently in college. I don't have much friends so I find it difficult to confide to anyone, and my parents used to be very strict and I usually perform well academically so I prefer not to let them down. So here I am here. I want to change myself for the better and I want to learn to care for myself (pursuing what my clear-headed self wants, not following my impulses to play video games, etc.).

When people ask me what I enjoy doing, I immediately say maths. I tried very hard in learning maths since 2 and a half years ago, and the context is that I was preparing for a ""high-level"" math exam. Thinking back to the time, I don't know if I tried so hard because I found maths fun, or because I just wanted to prove that I can achieve something impressive. Another thing is since 11th grade I started to lose friends and I truthfully don't know why I lose friends, but it could be because I am too scared at making conversations. So in 11th and 12th grade I tried instead very hard in learning even more math, doing both the IB higher level and Further level Maths. Of course, during that time I spent my free time not revising and doing math in doing my own stuff such as watching animate, playing games, etc.

However, I always try to take the hardest course in maths, so truthfully a part of me realizes that I do maths not because I like math, but I have some sort of ego and I want to prove to people around me that I am better than a great majority of the population (99.9%).

Now, I reach the point where I took way too much challenging classes in university, and it is almost finals and I find myself playing Minecraft and failing to control myself. Sometimes people ask me if I want to do something or have something to do, and I say ""I am busy"". Then, I say to myself ""I should probably use that time revising"" but end up playing minecraft (or another game but I believe they are still the same idea). I thought I liked maths, so I am supposed to find it as fun doing maths as playing minecraft, but my subconsciousness just push me to play minecraft rather than do maths, and I play several hours without stop, even if I initially allocate a small amount of time on it.

Something tells me that maybe to me, minecraft is like an alternative world where I basically can use my creativity to live a new life making a redstone farm etc., and that I pretty much am trying escaping reality by this method?

So, here is 2 questions I want to solve, and I want to ask if anyone can guide me to solving it:

1. Why don't I understand myself? How do I know if I really enjoy maths as itself? I am so confused even after 2 years of learning a load of maths.
2. What do I want in life? of course I want to feel happiness, but truthfully the only thing I know I want is recognition and for others to love me, and this I am sure I want. I just know this because my whole heart feels happy when I get recognition. Other than that, I really am not sure what I want long-term. Many times I imagine myself mastering all the math concepts and become some math genius, and people recognize me for my hard work and achievements. Another thing I want to say is I am sure I want to love doing math, but what if I don't love math in reality? It feels like many of my hobbies (piano, chess, math) are actually because I was forced or driven to do them in the past, but I don't even like them in reality, because I'd rather play something like Minecraft...

I think this post is also asking for people to recognize me, I don't know, but I think I am too lazy to reflect myself, or I don't know how to. I think it may also be because I want to have a conversation on my own problems.

PS: I really wish I can find something I enjoy doing not because I want recognition for it, but I just like that hobby for what it is. Maybe minecraft is one, but I really hope I can find maths fun so I can find something that is useful in life also interesting.I don't know why I don't do what I want, I don't know who I am"
,depression,"Hey all, 

So I've been dealing with depression for quite some time. I got diagnosed in winter of 2018, went on medication and it worked for a bit. I went off the medication a few months after being diagnosed. I was fine and really had no use for meds. 

Flash forward to January of this year and I came down with a major depressive episode. I consulted my doctor and got back on medication again. I was told to seek out counselling and am still seeking options for that. 

Despite suffering with depression I don't really feel depressed. It's not a matter of being down for me. Everything just seems to be a shady grey (no good nor bad). I've never considered harming myself. I've been in dark mindsets before but it's mostly just been a grey world for me lately.

I am done. I have no joy in my life. I sit behind my pc all day, supposed to finish my 4th and last year of my animation study. Im at a massive creative block, probably because i feel so bad all the time.
I am very lonely, i stopped talking to my friends because i am really anxious about social things. I let people walk all over me and i am way too nice.

I just dont have the green skin and big eyes. All my interactions with people are awkward, new people or people i know, family, whatever.
I stay up all night because i am afraid of laying in bed with my own thoughts, keeping my brother awake a lot of the time because of keyboard typing and talking etc.
This makes all of my family at home very mad and usually they just pull the internet. 
Pretty sure they all think i am very weird.
I jerk off way too much, i play video games all day instead of working on my last year of uni.
I wish i put more time into playing guitar, and maybe tried singing. But i cant push myself to sing because everyone can hear me and that makes me anxious. I wish i was nicer to my brother. I wish i showed people my emotions.
I am thinking about moving to a different country, but i might aswell just end it right here. I cant bare the pain i feel waking up, and the pain i inflict on my brother and parents. But i also dont want to add even more pain of me killing myself to my family. So i dont know what to do.

I know how that silent scream
Though painfully soundless it may seem
How its voice shatters your mind open
Hoping everything will end
Hoping that one day no one would remember
That time you almost pull the trigger

I know how to breathe yet drowning
Standing on the edge without jumping
Yet how it feels like you're constantly falling
Falling apart bit by bit while thinking
Should I do it, am I brave enough?
Asking, am I truly enough?

That coldness of steel on skin slicing
Through the relief and the tears it bring
And the warmth of that pool of red
How you have finally bled
The thoughts of how many times you've died
Along with the crushing grief inside

Those times when you can't even feel
And tell which is fake and which is real
Maybe a noose can show you what's true
Maybe it'll show how irrelevant is the real you
A short drop then you'll be forever flying
A worthlessness on a rope ever hanging

Countless ideas still bore a hole in my head
Should I rest or continue it instead
Then I'll realize how weak I truly am
How pretentious and fragile I really am
Maybe I really don't have the strength
Maybe I really want it but I just can't

It's then that I have found a friend

Maybe I really want it but I just can't

It's then that I have found a friend
It's the truth that maybe suicide just couldn't mend
Instead it's my palms that hug my swollen face
Bruises that again made my heart race
That hope of a dreamless night without a stop
That undying hope of sleeping without waking upAfter my ""self-punishment"" episode, I made this shitty poem. I have no one else to show it so I'll just post it here. I hope ya'll appreciate it."

&amp;nbsp;

Regardless of our coping mechanisms or the labels they give them, the effects of this disease remain. It itself remains. It takes you apart piece by piece. It wears down the people around you until they can't take it anymore. It leaves us alone, broken apart, fruitlessly trying to piece some semblance of an existence together.         

&amp;nbsp;

Is it any wonder why some people choose to check out? A real conversation needs to be had, because people's attitudes towards this disease are not changing for the better. The way they treat people with this disease is not changing for the better. It's all an assembly line to produce something they find palatable. Something they don't need to develop any self-awareness or perspective for. 

&amp;nbsp;

No one actually cares about the words on this screen, the person behind them, or the tears that fall onto the keyboard as they are typed. This entire website essentially functions as a social pressure relief valve. Clearly it's not working if the suicide statistics are any indication. I'm tired of pretending all of this is anything but a cruel joke.    

&amp;nbsp;

The reality is what it is and I'm done surviving in it.Reality check."
,depression,"I've met this one friend of my (he won't see this so Ill call him by his real name) Christian, back in November of 2019. We've been good friends, until he starts talking about this one girl he has been talking to (she won't see this so Ill call her by her real name) sage and I think of the name and it seem familiar but I don't really think about that much and I've seen her before bet he tell me so much about him and her like how they've madeout and how've they had the threesome with a mutual friend named Gabe. Then I went over to his house early in the morning (note they weren't dating, but sage and christian both call sage his main hoe) and she also comes over but he did not tell me she was coming over. I then realized I've known her since third grade she just had blond hair and a gap in her teeth (with at the time I thought was cute) and she still has her speech impediment which I think is cute also. She then remembers me, and I asked christian if they we're dating and he said no, I then asked if he cared if I flirted with her, he said no again. I start to flirt and she flirted back. After some talking we started to talk and he watched us make out which was really weird. Christian, Sage,Christian's sister Karli, and I went to the local park and just messed around because no one was there me and sage were talking and hanging around and I guess christian got mad so he wanted to talk to Karli, so Karli told sage and me to go to the baseball dugout  and when we did we looked around and played tic-tac-toe on the wall and then I picked her up ( mind you I'm 5'8 and she is around 5'3ish) and have her put her legs around my waist and I pinned her against a wall and we made out for a while. Then Karli called us over right before I was going to ask sage out then christian pulled sage aside and asked her out before I could. She said yes too. After walking around some more I went home and cut my self on my right wrist. It felt heart breaking anytime I saw them together but I knew who she was, she didn't care if she was in a relationship or not if you don't give her dick she will find someone to give her dick... Christian had to go home early and Sage had to get something from Dollar General so I went with her. I went home with her and another friend and we went through her camera roll and watched pet cemetery but when the friend left her cat got on my legs when they were crossed and let's say she missed petting the cat on purpose and I pet her pussy on purpose too. A week or two later she calls him a cheater and he breaks up with him and I am not at all the extrovert type so it took a week to even ask her out but she changed the subject by saying I'm going to a fuck buddy's house later. So I felt great after that and we really never talked since and now we're here and I still have suicidal thoughts and want to cut myself daily but Im trying not too but I know one day I wont be able to stop it.

TL;DR My friend tells me about this girl. I hit it off with her he starts to date her she cheats on him with me she calls him a cheater they break up I ask her out she changes the subject and she stops talking to me.

,depression,"22F. I don't know if what I am feeling is normal, or if I really should be looking for help. For the past 5 or so years I believe I've been struggling with depression. This past summer was probably the worst it has ever been, but I am currently doing okay. I don't know if I am depressed because I can work/ hang out with friends and I do enjoy some parts of life.  I have a part-time job that I do that pays well enough to cover rent/expenses. I don't love it there, and that is another side issue but I haven't been low enough that I can't get up and go to work when I need to.

I have self-harmed on and off for the past five years, not enough to leave permanent or noticeable damage but it is something I am so ashamed of that I have never told a soul, and I don't think anyone notices. More recently I go through periods of starving myself, or eating a lot less than I should be. I am a normal weight and don't believe its an ED, but it is something that I will do on purpose when I am depressed/ feeling low.

,depression,"I’m at a complete loss and have no idea where to look. My whole life people have perceived me as the funny, goofy extrovert. To be fair it’s a role I’ve given to myself, growing up I would always try to dismiss anything I found negative with a joke. Being the funny one allowed me to hide from reality and kept me happy. This worked fine throughout elementary school and made me a pretty happy kid, yet in middle school things started taking a turn for the worse. 

For as I can remember I’ve struggled with ADHD and anger issues. After middle school and throughout high school I started developing symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and borderline bipolarism. Im not sure if I can say I was bullied, but I have definitely been traumatized by certain friend groups and people. For example, in grades 8 and 9 I was in a toxic friend group with the older “cool kids”. Because I was the young one I was always seen as lesser and treated like I was everyone’s verbal punching bag. I would often be excluded from events or embarrassed in class because of the teasing. In grade 11 I once got confronted by an angry mob of big dudes because some guy that I beat up (in complete self defence) told someone that I was making fun of his autistic friend. This resulted in me getting circled and nearly lynched (not literally, at least I hope) for something I didn’t do. I still struggle with severe PTSD from that day. 

I’m not fucked up all of the time, sometimes I’ll go weeks feeling like I’m on cloud 9. But no matter what it all comes back eventually. The only thing I’ve actually had diagnosed is ADHD, simply because I have no idea how to explain my other internal struggles nor do I want to. Very rarely will I tell someone that I need help. Anytime I’ve ever tried to bring them up friends or family my problems were trivialized and met with responses like “oh things will get better with time” or “just wait till you’re an adult, you’ll figure it out”. 

Well I’m an adult now, and I sure as fuck haven’t figured it out. I struggle with the same issues I’ve had since I was a kid, and it’s made me feel so terribly isolated no matter how many friends/family I’m surrounded by. I’ve resorted to smoking weed every single day until I pass out to try and keep my problems at bay while I try to finish university. This has made me a lazy cunt that struggles to maintain what used to be my favourite hobby, bodybuilding. I’ve tried quitting a few times, however whenever I stay sober for long enough the dark stuff that’s haunted me my entire life just comes back. 

I’ve had to quit drinking, I can’t party with my friends anymore because every time I get drunk I let out years of suppressed anger and frustration. I’ve gotten into many drunk fights, and it’s gotten to the point where I will talk shit to people twice my size without any rational thought behind it. While drunk, it’s either the version of me that loves everyone and will strike up a conversation with strangers to maybe get a laugh or some new friends, or it’s the version of me that is a complete asshole and wants to beat the shit out of anyone that gives even the slightest indication that they want to fight. This is why I ended up loving weed so much, when I’m baked I’m the nice version of myself that I recognize from when I was kid. Fuck I wish I could go back to my childhood.

I don’t blame people for not understanding, I can never communicate it properly. Every time I’ve met with my psychiatrist it’s like I’m describing a completely different issue, I often times over exaggerate or under exaggerate certain symptoms for literally no reason, it’s like I just panic and lie whenever someone try’s to get me to open up. Because of this inconsistency lots of people just assume I’m full of shit all the time and I’ve definitely lost credibility on certain subjects. I’m only 19 years old, and I’m starting to reach my breaking point. I don’t know what is causing all of this, but there is nothing I want more than to feel consistently normal. 

If you were to see me in public, you wouldn’t guess any of this. You would see a nice, funny extrovert that has a wonderful family, good friends and gets good grades. Behind that mask is a lonely cunt that doesn’t fully understand other people and sure as fuck doesn’t understand himself. I do have lots of great friends and I couldn’t have asked for a better family, however despite my blessings I feel terribly cursed.

I’ve had to quit drinking, I can’t party with my friends anymore because every time I get drunk I let out years of suppressed anger and frustration. I’ve gotten into many drunk fights, and it’s gotten to the point where I will talk shit to people twice my size without any rational thought behind it. While drunk, it’s either the version of me that loves everyone and will strike up a conversation with strangers to maybe get a laugh or some new friends, or it’s the version of me that is a complete asshole and wants to beat the shit out of anyone that gives even the slightest indication that they want to fight. This is why I ended up loving weed so much, when I’m baked I’m the nice version of myself that I recognize from when I was kid. Fuck I wish I could go back to my childhood.

I don’t blame people for not understanding, I can never communicate it properly. Every time I’ve met with my psychiatrist it’s like I’m describing a completely different issue, I often times over exaggerate or under exaggerate certain symptoms for literally no reason, it’s like I just panic and lie whenever someone try’s to get me to open up. Because of this inconsistency lots of people just assume I’m full of shit all the time and I’ve definitely lost credibility on certain subjects. I’m only 19 years old, and I’m starting to reach my breaking point. I don’t know what is causing all of this, but there is nothing I want more than to feel consistently normal. 

If you were to see me in public, you wouldn’t guess any of this. You would see a nice, funny extrovert that has a wonderful family, good friends and gets good grades. Behind that mask is a lonely cunt that doesn’t fully understand other people and sure as fuck doesn’t understand himself. I do have lots of great friends and I couldn’t have asked for a better family, however despite my blessings I feel terribly cursed. 

Please, does anybody have some advice???Desperately need help but can never seem to get results"

This paycheck to paycheck bullshit is killing me mentally. I pinch every penny I get but it eventually slips from my grasp. I drink on the weekends. Just to bring a lil light into my life. Thought of killing myself but my wife is what I hold on to. She’s my life. My whole world. I just hate that I have to share her and that it’s not just me and her yet. She understands my pain and my problems. She tells me to hold on and that we will be free of all this some day. I use to believe her completely but as of late Iv been growing further and further from the idea. I’m just so tired.I’m so tired"

I think people are being mean to me when they’re just making conversation. I used to be very masculine. What is happening? Any advice would be much appreciated.


Edit: I would say low testosterone, but I don’t exhibit other signs, such as I am in good shape.Why do I have so many mood swings? (28m)"

About two years ago I was diagnosed with narcolepsy. This diagnosis caused me to be separated from the military. At the time I was ok with it. I felt that it was just a sign to move on to another stage of my life. From there I decided to go back to school. I wanted to finish my degree and get a job using that degree. This would have went well but unforeseen circumstances have caused some major issues with that plan. The school isn’t offering the classes that I need to finish the degree for at least a term for one and two for the other courses. With school being payed by the VA and them also providing a housing allowance this was my source of income, but I can’t get that in on if I’m not going to school. I was fully prepared to cut down on spending while I waited to find a job to tide me over. I am married and my wife has a steady job so at least we have some income, but I have been the only one to cut down on the spending. While trying to get my wife to cut down a little bit on spending, she decided to get an additional job to earn a little extra money. Initially I was very happy with that. The thing is she has been always working and I am struggling to get a job. The bills were fine initially but eventually credit card began having higher and higher balances and the savings began dwindling. My wife has been using her second job not to assist in paying the bills but to sequester away to use as fun money. Again no issue initially. Over time it was notice that more an more time and money was spent towards time with her friends while I ended up stuck at home based on the fact that money was leaving faster than it was coming in. I have asked to be included, but she tells me she doesn’t want my negativity around her friends. This hurt me and made me take a close look at the situation. The past year or so communication has really been almost nonexistent between us about the happenings of our lives. This was ok when I was In The military because I spent a large portion of my time at work. I really wanted to push towards better communication and time together when we could get it without cutting out her friends.  I began working my communication while I was busy with school. I made sure to tell her when I had free time so that we could spend time together. Multiple times that I let her know that I was going to be free on a specific day or that I would make time to spend with her when I knew she was free, she would instead make plans with her friends. Time after time of this happening has just beat me down emotionally. It’s even more noticeable now that I am home all the time job hunting and I still get to see my wife less then her friends see her. The combination of the situations that put me in an idle state and it seeming like she doesn’t want to be around me has put me in a very dark place. I have been seeing a counselor with her over the past couple of months in hopes of rebuilding the communication bridge and trying to get her to see how I feel and me to see how she feels about everything. The thing is that whenever a conversation about such things happens between us she glazes over and it seems like no attention is being payed. This again bashed my self worth. The counselor eventually referred me to a medical professional who diagnosed me with major depression and prescribed me medication. The medication helps for the most part, but I keep getting lack of value impressions from my wife that just puts me right back in my hole. Over the past few months I have thought about suicide many many times. I have never thought about doing it, just about how I could do it. This scares the crap out of me. It takes a lot of thinking about my parents and my sister to get those negative thoughts out of my head. I am at a loss though I love my wife so much, and I think my wife loves me in her own way. The thing is us not being on the same page is destroying me, and in turn our relationship. I know it’s not all my fault and that it’s not all hers, it is a combination of everything. I feel like I have been bending over backwards to promote healing in my life and my relationship with my wife. I don’t feel that I am getting the effort back from my wife. I am at a loss of what to do. I can’t seem to dig myself out of this hole and I can’t seem to get the help from my wife because neither of us know how. My wife not knowing how to help seems to have turned into not wanting to deal with it.

,depression,"I can sit here on Reddit all damn day and night, and then when I'm bored of whatever little content that slithers onto my home page, I just go to look over to my steam games. Nothing interests me. Nothing. I load up a game and immediately turn it off.

,depression,"I am super done with life. I hate living. I hate looking in front of the mirror everyday and looking at my reflection. I delusionally quit computer science when I realized even if I make 150k a year it wouldn't be enough to support my family let alone the people in my neighborhood. I don't know, I guess over time you start to sympathize with the kid who has crackhead parents and realize, there is an unlikely chance he is going down an educated path. Just by observing those people with same scenario my age. I look at homeless people and wonder the same thing. They are put on pills that keep them on streets because pharmacies is just a business. In my city the people prescribing them just need money and a job. The thing I hate most about myself too is the fact I feel sorry for myself, there are kids in the middle East who get drugged from a young age and used for militaristic purposes. There is the camps in China where people are getting raped, kids who are being kidnapped and used for organ harvesting and kept alive. People say the world is getting better but it feels blind. I know people in Canada like to seek themselves as good, but is buying a phone not technically supporting those evil acts. The truth is those phones are being made by underpaid workers in a different country.  There's also so many other issues. Like a lot of people hate on hip hop music and the hypersexuality and hypercriminalty aspect of it, but there's so many more layers to that. These artist who need to comply to middle class market since middle class kids bring in revenue from buying tickets to shows. They get all the blame for that type of music but the reality is they make it for the industry. If middle class kids liked bubbly music I'm a 100% certain these poor artist would start making music like that. The truth is in poor areas the reality is if you choose to go to school, you won't be able to support your familly so the two paths that do make enough money is selling drugs, or making music and blowing up. The other sad truth is 1 in some big number artist make it. Look at all those artist, most of the poor ones were criminals or lived a gangster lifestyle (in this generation). A lot of these artist don't want to do that. NBA youngboy (jail, drugs, etc), the Kelly (killed best friend), Kodak black (drugs, jail, etc).  
Why don't they just do pop? No resources, not enough time to work a 8 hour job, sing, create, etc. A lot of pop artist have big teams. If your a female in a poor area you're even more screwed. Most famous female artist in the industry went to music schools, were rich, and had connections. Their isn't much opportunity for them that can support their love ones. We see those who succeeded but not many of those who didn't. A lot of them did put work in too. My whole point is humans are corrupt and some people get the back end of it while others get built up from those people. The pharmacies, the organ harvesters, etc. Even everyday people are, we just been dehumanized to it, or are just blind to their actions. Anyways I ask myself, why should you live if you're just at the bottom? Hope? We see all these inspirational stories but the reality is most people don't end up like that. You have to pick a poison. In the world we live in it's getting harder and harder for people to make it out. Kids getting drugged at young age, underpaid workers with no education and no one willing to hand that out. Homeless people, being put into a loop, and from what I've seen, a lot of ignorant people judging them. Why should I live, work 5 times harder, sacrifice all of my free time, just to end up having the same job as the other guy? Also, I mentioned I hate myself even more for being ungrateful cause some people have less, but why? Why should that be okay? Why is that something you can tell someone. Be grateful, someone out there has it way worse. I disagree with telling someone that. There should be a fine line. I think kids shouldn't get drugged from a young age and turned into tools. Why is suicide looked down upon is what I'm asking. Hell, should I tell that homeless person to have hope? Statistically speaking, things aren't getting better for him. Enjoy the little things. This is where I am just being a brat, but it's hard to enjoy those things when I don't know if I'm getting food tommorow, and then I see someone on social media skiing down a mountain with no cares in the world. Humans are competitive by nature and being at the bottom you don't have many sense of achievement especially in the era we live in. It kinda gets to you. What is the point of living? Friends and family I never see cause we all have our own schedules and are super busy busting our asses off? Also people do care they just to social media to help. Reality is that doesn't help. We had a protest in my city recently and the way protesting in this era works is you make a post on your page. You can't get violent or cause disruption or else you get arrested. Therefore you just watch them as they do the thing you don't want. It seems like half the time people bring awareness to stuff it's cause it's trendy too. I saw so many post on the Australian fires, but a few on the Uighur camps in China. I saw millions mourn the death of a rapper, but minimal awareness to other things that are way worse cause it isn't trendy. Respect to black live matters but but what happens if you do that with another race? It doesn't work. Some races are getting fucked over way harder in this day and age. No one puts their hand up cause it's not a trendy movement, not to say the movements they support aren't important. 8.4 mill on black lives and less than 100000 combined on Mexican and brown. Sorry random rants in random order. Lots to get off my chest. What's the point of living. I'm a brown guy from a poor neighbourhood so just being a famous artist would be way harder just cause of my colour. I looked it up, and found only 1 brown person in a list of upcoming artist and actors list. The rest were predominantly white or black. Statistically speaking, woman are less interested in brown guys. Even brown chicks guys from other races. I'd say a lack of media portrayal has a doing in that. The other options aren't so friendly either. Go to school and not support my family. Bust my ass off, start a business and make enough money but at that point my chances are the same in music.

,depression,The depression is so bad at this point.  My wife hates me and wants to divorce me.

,depression,"Before I start, I want to apologize for rambling and possibly repeating similar statements, I am so terribly depressed and feel I have lost everything.

I, 20M two weeks ago had matched with a girl 18F I will call Madlad. I had given up completely on online dating and was convinced that everyone my age was just looking for a band aid for loneliness and had no chance of finding a loving relationship.

She was like no other. Even though I had low energy with replies she showed so much interest and we really hit it off. She ended up asking if I wanted to facetime in which I agreed.

We started facetiming and it was not awkward at all, we both felt an emotional connection to eachother and proceeded for the next three days to facetime for hours on end while we did homework or were just hanging out in our rooms.

I live in Minneapolis while she goes to school in Wisconsin roughly an hour and a half away. I drove out last friday and she joked saying this was crazy in a joking way, we finally met and she came in for a hug instantly, we helped he friends move dorms which I met everyone before we went up to her dorm and I sat around doing homework with her before the tension became to strong and I asked if she wanted to watch something after we got food.

We ended up cuddling together and just enjoying each others presence, we had deep conversations until she said that she has major trust issues, and although we just met, she feels super connected to me. I reciprocate the same feelings and don't quite understand what she means by trust issues.

She ends up talking really personally about her high school boyfriends and although I know exactly what I would want to say, I can not and just proceed to listen and comfort her. I laugh it off and say ""I accept the challenge!"" that the trust issues latched onto her defend.

I end up leaving the night and I feel like it went really well until I wake up the next morning... I tend to be quite overbearing and I am in no means good in texting but a master at connecting with people in person, she responds to my good morning  text and how I feel super great about her and that I see something with her. She responds hesitantly saying she was so scared when she woke up and feels that she just let me in and was regretting it, she says even though it feels so right and that I am such a nice guy that she just needed time to process.

My responses were minuscule at best, I was no help and just tried to relate and talk about my past with people in an effort to understand what she has been going through. I was at work while this was going on and I was extremely stressed out. The whole time through our texts just felt like she was pushing me away so I decided ""f this, I can't deal with this right now."" I end up leaving work early and drive the hour and a half around 4PM last saturday.

I call her pulled into the college dorm parking lot saying ""Im sorry, I didnt want to facetime or text about all of this and I know we said we would after work but long story short I drove out and im in the parking lot.""

She reads my text and calls me 3 minutes later, the suspense feels like I just ruined everything... she calls and says shes not there, that she is out at dinner with friends and doesnt know when she will get back. I told her Im sorry and that I can leave, she says its up to me when I without hesitation say ""I want to talk to you... I want to see you..."" She pauses and says okay, she texts saying shes sorry and that shes just in shock but is excited to see me.

50 minutes pass and she pulls in and walks to my car since she randomly pulls next to me. we just kind of laugh before I hug her and we quietly walk up to her dorm where we begin talking about everything.

She tells me while trying not to cry that she doesnt want me to deal with her and that she really likes me and feels like she will hurt me. In summary, we let some of our emotions out and end up cuddling again before we see her friends for a bit, she feels closer to me and more open now, I end up leaving and tell her thank you for not flat our rejecting me. I knew it was 50/50 but if what I felt like I knew about her was true, I knew she wouldn't reject seeing and talking to me in person.

As I drove home that night, I get pulled over for going 87 in a 70 by an officer and am hit with a $250 ticket. I get home around 2AM and tell her I miss her and begin to be super overbearing again. I tell her I got a ticket and Im sorry if Im waking her up and that if I ruined her image of me by getting a ticket since this was my first ever run in with the police and I didnt know what to do or say, all I could think about was how she would see me.

She waited up the 2 hours at night for me to get home safe and says I didnt ruin anything and that she really liked seeing me and to have a good sleep. I woke up and proceeded to text her goodmorning and thank you for not pushing me away and kept telling her how she makes me feel. I am a triple scorpio if anyone believes in or knows what that is and I am extremely ambitious and passionate but with that comes impatience and a great need for discipline while she is a virgo.

She relapses back to the hesitation and we text very lightly, just seems like we were friends and that she felt afraid that she was opening up to me and letting me in her life.

the week goes by and she tells me shes sorry I have to deal with her, that she really likes me and sees something with me and is afraid since shes never been treated nice in the past before. I try to hold myself back and just say its okay and that I care about her, we keep telling eachother through the week how much we mean to one another and how crazy it is that we just met.

We facetime on tuesday and she says she just wanted to talk about her feelings and we get really deep into our lives, where we want to be, how we feel about eachother, the whole shabang. We end the call and she tells me that talking to me made her feel a lot better about everything and that she wanted me to come over tomorrow (aka wednesday, few days ago) everything is feeling better and I drive out after my classes to be with her, we just cuddle for a few hours and talk more about what we want and how we see eachother where she asks me if I can be hers, and that if we are officially dating she will feel way better about everything. I just smile and say ofcourse before kissing her and we begin to makeout before we go bowling with her friend group.

All of her friends really like me and we click super well, I feel integrated except with one girl who is overly dramatic with everyone.

I leave and tell her thanks for the great night and that Ill text her when I get home. Luckily no ticket this time and we say goodnight as she still waits up for me when she didnt need to. (was a school night for her) we plan to hangout on the weekend which is where we are now.

I drove over yesterday after work (friday) and we spend the day with eachother. We cuddle and go on a triple date with her friends and their gf/bf's, we laugh how cringey it is but we are so happy together, nothing seems weird and we go back to her dorm that night after hanging out with everybody and I asked if its still okay if I sleep over, she says ofcourse and we get comfy and get to bed.

I begin talking to her and asking her how she stills feels etc. and she talks about how she feels safe and happy with me and that she needs time. we makeout and I go a lot farther than we both thought I would intimately, no sex which is fine since if we ever do make love I never want her to feel like its something to regret. This is where I make the mistake that I need advice with...

Early in the night she talks about love and how she views it. She is very practical and says there is no love at first sight, that she was in love once but from being completely rejected had completely damaged her. That there is only infatuation and love is a two way thing.

I tell her around 1am yesterday (or today however you view it) that I dont just feel infatuated, I didnt say it but she knew, she immediately stopped me and said, ""No, dont say that..."" I get stressed out and she says I didnt ruin anything but she doesnt feel the same way, that I barely know her and that she wants to take it slow. We makeout again etc and fondle eachother blah blah.

I ask her every question I have had building up and let myself go, I give up and feel completely destroyed as how attached I have grown to her. I recognize I fall hard and she knows that and tells me that. She says she sees something long term with me and how she knows her family would love me and wouldnt be trying to make us work if she didnt see a future with me, that she really cares about me but doesnt want to feel any regret and make any mistakes.

we go to bed and she wakes me up about an hour later just kissing me and moving my hand under her shirt etc until I become fully awake and try to go for it, I move my fingers down below where she stops me and says, ""fuck you"" in her beautiful and snarky voice, that she hates me (jokingly) I say why? and she says because I know what Im doing, and that I am making it very difficult to hold back and she needs my help. I stop and we go back to bed for real this time after I say sorry for saying ""the thing"" she says its okay and that it didnt happen.

She wakes up before me and starts kissing me again while Im asleep and does the same thing where we are just enjoying eacothers touch feel that sense of physicality and love. I subconsciously say ""I love you"" which freaks her out.

Keep in mind I do remember saying this but I was half awake and fell asleep almost instantly after saying it, I didnt really know if she heard me or not, it just came out, it is how I feeland have been feeling and been trying so hard not to say. 

She goes blank faced for the next hour until I wake up and see her so distraught, I ask whats wrong, (This is this morning by the way) until she says I am stupid, I didnt mean it, I dont know her and I dont know what love is. I just sit there with my heart aching. I say I was asleep and didnt mean it and that Im sorry. She says its okay and we proceed to cuddle in until 11:40AM on and off making out and teasing eachother knowing we cant do anything because it was too soon. I say Im sorry for ruining any other chance of coming over and she says its okay, and ""You didnt say anything, were okay.""

We go out to lunch with her friends and everything feels find, she doesnt feel like shes rejecting me or weird in any ways, just her normal smiley happy self. We get back and we cuddle again before we both fall asleep for 3 hours, I dreamt about her and was still so destroyed and didnt know how to feel. 

For the longest time even though I am not religious I had felt that I am just some NPC being controlled by god and the devil letting fate control my journey until I met this girl and chose to make my own decisions, that I cant wait around for anything and that this girl is someone I can see myself being with for the rest of my life no matter how early it may be.

we wake up and I get ready to leave since she wants to hang out with her friends alone later since the one over dramatic friend earlier is jealous that she found someone and that everyone but her is dating somebody. I say sorry one more time and I can tell she is hiding how she is feeling, that she will end up rejecting the feelings again no matter how real they may seem to me. We say bye and she says text me when I get home

Now we are here. 8:50PM Saturday 3/7/2020... This is how the convo goes and keep in mind I can tell she is ignoring how she feels and doesnt want to think about anything I tried to tell her

Me: Made it home

Madlad: okay good :)

Me: Hope things are good with your friends

Madlad: not really but hope she will be

Me: yeah... Thanks for the fun weekend madlad, I know I made it go downhill but that is the lowest it could go, everything going forward will be better I promise. You have really been trusting of me, I know you are going really fast which is why its my turn to slow down so its not you doing all of the work, everythings alreadu out and said so the last thing is just time. Have a goodnight madlad, ill stop spamming you and stuff, you really mean a lot to me.

Madlad: thank you knarsan. I had a fun weekend to (heart face emoji)

20 minutes later Madlad: my friend ditched on us.

Me: Im sorry, what are you up to the rest of the night

Madlad: its whatever lol, we are doing shots and watching movies lol

Me: cool (I dont drink by the way, not trying to be judgemental, I just dont really participate in the subculture and can come off as a dick a lot of the time reddit :/ )

Madlad: whats wrong

Me: nothings wrong haha be safe! (Im saying this while typing this thing out and slowly dying inside, I am currently listening to biggie smalls ready to die album and Electric Light Orchestras Out of the Blue album while crying.)

Madlad: Ill be safe (heart emoji)

Me: (the stupid little excited/smile emoji)

Madlad: Im gonna get shitfaced I think

\- I read this but dont really know what to respond so dont

3 min later Madlad: im sorry I drink lol

Me: you dont have any reason to be sorry, im sorry I make you feel like im judging you on that.

Madlad: you dont I just dont want you to think less of me

Me: I dont (Still dying inside)

Madlad: okay good :)

Me: I just care about you, If I judged you on every little thing I dont think you would want to be with me

Madlad: I care about you too, Ill be safe

I didnt respond to this and thats the end of the story, its now 9:05PM and I am completely lost and dont know how to feel, what to do, how to react, how I should feel, how she wants me to feel etc.

I overthink and I am a love addict by nature, I am not ashamed of it but I am starting to be, I am learning and experiencing something new and really want this all to work but I dont know what to do... I could really use some sort of guide or just something

I do love her, thats why im so hurt, I dont want to push her away but this constant self torment destroys me and makes me want to look over the gorge's of vermont and contemplate whether I am worth it for anyone, if I will ever feel the loving embrace of someone. I know I am probably over reacting but I am struggling to battle with myself and dont know who to tell since I in reality have no friends I would trust.

She has trust issues and I never wanted to tell her I did to since that would push her away, I am compeltely open to sharing myself with her which is why I dont have the same problems as her and im definitely going through the weight of loneliness and depression while she is battling the way of people and what others could do to possibly hurt her again. I just want her to feel cared for, I want her to feel the same thing I crave, the loving embrace of a soulmate...

&lt;p&gt;the week goes by and she tells me shes sorry I have to deal with her, that she really likes me and sees something with me and is afraid since shes never been treated nice in the past before. I try to hold myself back and just say its okay and that I care about her, we keep telling eachother through the week how much we mean to one another and how crazy it is that we just met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We facetime on tuesday and she says she just wanted to talk about her feelings and we get really deep into our lives, where we want to be, how we feel about eachother, the whole shabang. We end the call and she tells me that talking to me made her feel a lot better about everything and that she wanted me to come over tomorrow (aka wednesday, few days ago) everything is feeling better and I drive out after my classes to be with her, we just cuddle for a few hours and talk more about what we want and how we see eachother where she asks me if I can be hers, and that if we are officially dating she will feel way better about everything. I just smile and say ofcourse before kissing her and we begin to makeout before we go bowling with her friend group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of her friends really like me and we click super well, I feel integrated except with one girl who is overly dramatic with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave and tell her thanks for the great night and that Ill text her when I get home. Luckily no ticket this time and we say goodnight as she still waits up for me when she didnt need to. (was a school night for her) we plan to hangout on the weekend which is where we are now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drove over yesterday after work (friday) and we spend the day with eachother. We cuddle and go on a triple date with her friends and their gf/bf&amp;#39;s, we laugh how cringey it is but we are so happy together, nothing seems weird and we go back to her dorm that night after hanging out with everybody and I asked if its still okay if I sleep over, she says ofcourse and we get comfy and get to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I begin talking to her and asking her how she stills feels etc. and she talks about how she feels safe and happy with me and that she needs time. we makeout and I go a lot farther than we both thought I would intimately, no sex which is fine since if we ever do make love I never want her to feel like its something to regret. This is where I make the mistake that I need advice with...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the night she talks about love and how she views it. She is very practical and says there is no love at first sight, that she was in love once but from being completely rejected had completely damaged her. That there is only infatuation and love is a two way thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tell her around 1am yesterday (or today however you view it) that I dont just feel infatuated, I didnt say it but she knew, she immediately stopped me and said, &amp;quot;No, dont say that...&amp;quot; I get stressed out and she says I didnt ruin anything but she doesnt feel the same way, that I barely know her and that she wants to take it slow. We makeout again etc and fondle eachother blah blah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask her every question I have had building up and let myself go, I give up and feel completely destroyed as how attached I have grown to her. I recognize I fall hard and she knows that and tells me that. She says she sees something long term with me and how she knows her family would love me and wouldnt be trying to make us work if she didnt see a future with me, that she really cares about me but doesnt want to feel any regret and make any mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we go to bed and she wakes me up about an hour later just kissing me and moving my hand under her shirt etc until I become fully awake and try to go for it, I move my fingers down below where she stops me and says, &amp;quot;fuck you&amp;quot; in her beautiful and snarky voice, that she hates me (jokingly) I say why? and she says because I know what Im doing, and that I am making it very difficult to hold back and she needs my help. I stop and we go back to bed for real this time after I say sorry for saying &amp;quot;the thing&amp;quot; she says its okay and that it didnt happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wakes up before me and starts kissing me again while Im asleep and does the same thing where we are just enjoying eacothers touch feel that sense of physicality and love. I subconsciously say &amp;quot;I love you&amp;quot; which freaks her out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind I do remember saying this but I was half awake and fell asleep almost instantly after saying it, I didnt really know if she heard me or not, it just came out, it is how I feeland have been feeling and been trying so hard not to say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She goes blank faced for the next hour until I wake up and see her so distraught, I ask whats wrong, (This is this morning by the way) until she says I am stupid, I didnt mean it, I dont know her and I dont know what love is. I just sit there with my heart aching. I say I was asleep and didnt mean it and that Im sorry. She says its okay and we proceed to cuddle in until 11:40AM on and off making out and teasing eachother knowing we cant do anything because it was too soon. I say Im sorry for ruining any other chance of coming over and she says its okay, and &amp;quot;You didnt say anything, were okay.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We go out to lunch with her friends and everything feels find, she doesnt feel like shes rejecting me or weird in any ways, just her normal smiley happy self. We get back and we cuddle again before we both fall asleep for 3 hours, I dreamt about her and was still so destroyed and didnt know how to feel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the longest time even though I am not religious I had felt that I am just some NPC being controlled by god and the devil letting fate control my journey until I met this girl and chose to make my own decisions, that I cant wait around for anything and that this girl is someone I can see myself being with for the rest of my life no matter how early it may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we wake up and I get ready to leave since she wants to hang out with her friends alone later since the one over dramatic friend earlier is jealous that she found someone and that everyone but her is dating somebody. I say sorry one more time and I can tell she is hiding how she is feeling, that she will end up rejecting the feelings again no matter how real they may seem to me. We say bye and she says text me when I get home&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are here. 8:50PM Saturday 3/7/2020... This is how the convo goes and keep in mind I can tell she is ignoring how she feels and doesnt want to think about anything I tried to tell her&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Made it home&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madlad: okay good :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Hope things are good with your friends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madlad: not really but hope she will be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: yeah... Thanks for the fun weekend madlad, I know I made it go downhill but that is the lowest it could go, everything going forward will be better I promise. You have really been trusting of me, I know you are going really fast which is why its my turn to slow down so its not you doing all of the work, everythings alreadu out and said so the last thing is just time. Have a goodnight madlad, ill stop spamming you and stuff, you really mean a lot to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madlad: thank you knarsan. I had a fun weekend to (heart face emoji)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20 minutes later Madlad: my friend ditched on us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Im sorry, what are you up to the rest of the night&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madlad: its whatever lol, we are doing shots and watching movies lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: cool (I dont drink by the way, not trying to be judgemental, I just dont really participate in the subculture and can come off as a dick a lot of the time reddit :/ )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madlad: whats wrong&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: nothings wrong haha be safe! (Im saying this while typing this thing out and slowly dying inside, I am currently listening to biggie smalls ready to die album and Electric Light Orchestras Out of the Blue album while crying.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madlad: Ill be safe (heart emoji)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: (the stupid little excited/smile emoji)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madlad: Im gonna get shitfaced I think&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I read this but dont really know what to respond so dont&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 min later Madlad: im sorry I drink lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: you dont have any reason to be sorry, im sorry I make you feel like im judging you on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madlad: you dont I just dont want you to think less of me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I dont (Still dying inside)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madlad: okay good :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: I just care about you, If I judged you on every little thing I dont think you would want to be with me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madlad: I care about you too, Ill be safe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didnt respond to this and thats the end of the story, its now 9:05PM and I am completely lost and dont know how to feel, what to do, how to react, how I should feel, how she wants me to feel etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I overthink and I am a love addict by nature, I am not ashamed of it but I am starting to be, I am learning and experiencing something new and really want this all to work but I dont know what to do... I could really use some sort of guide or just something&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do love her, thats why im so hurt, I dont want to push her away but this constant self torment destroys me and makes me want to look over the gorge&amp;#39;s of vermont and contemplate whether I am worth it for anyone, if I will ever feel the loving embrace of someone. I know I am probably over reacting but I am struggling to battle with myself and dont know who to tell since I in reality have no friends I would trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has trust issues and I never wanted to tell her I did to since that would push her away, I am compeltely open to sharing myself with her which is why I dont have the same problems as her and im definitely going through the weight of loneliness and depression while she is battling the way of people and what others could do to possibly hurt her again. I just want her to feel cared for, I want her to feel the same thing I crave, the loving embrace of a soulmate...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so sorry&lt;/p&gt;

I, 20M two weeks ago had matched with a girl 18F I will call Madlad. I had given up completely on online dating and was convinced that everyone my age was just looking for a band aid for loneliness and had no chance of finding a loving relationship.

She was like no other. Even though I had low energy with replies she showed so much interest and we really hit it off. She ended up asking if I wanted to facetime in which I agreed.

We started facetiming and it was not awkward at all, we both felt an emotional connection to eachother and proceeded for the next three days to facetime for hours on end while we did homework or were just hanging out in our rooms.

I live in Minneapolis while she goes to school in Wisconsin roughly an hour and a half away. I drove out last friday and she joked saying this was crazy in a joking way, we finally met and she came in for a hug instantly, we helped he friends move dorms which I met everyone before we went up to her dorm and I sat around doing homework with her before the tension became to strong and I asked if she wanted to watch something after we got food.

We ended up cuddling together and just enjoying each others presence, we had deep conversations until she said that she has major trust issues, and although we just met, she feels super connected to me. I reciprocate the same feelings and don't quite understand what she means by trust issues.

She ends up talking really personally about her high school boyfriends and although I know exactly what I would want to say, I can not and just proceed to listen and comfort her. I laugh it off and say ""I accept the challenge!"" that the trust issues latched onto her defend.

I end up leaving the night and I feel like it went really well until I wake up the next morning... I tend to be quite overbearing and I am in no means good in texting but a master at connecting with people in person, she responds to my good morning  text and how I feel super great about her and that I see something with her. She responds hesitantly saying she was so scared when she woke up and feels that she just let me in and was regretting it, she says even though it feels so right and that I am such a nice guy that she just needed time to process.

My responses were minuscule at best, I was no help and just tried to relate and talk about my past with people in an effort to understand what she has been going through. I was at work while this was going on and I was extremely stressed out. The whole time through our texts just felt like she was pushing me away so I decided ""f this, I can't deal with this right now."" I end up leaving work early and drive the hour and a half around 4PM last saturday.

I call her pulled into the college dorm parking lot saying ""Im sorry, I didnt want to facetime or text about all of this and I know we said we would after work but long story short I drove out and im in the parking lot.""

She reads my text and calls me 3 minutes later, the suspense feels like I just ruined everything... she calls and says shes not there, that she is out at dinner with friends and doesnt know when she will get back. I told her Im sorry and that I can leave, she says its up to me when I without hesitation say ""I want to talk to you... I want to see you..."" She pauses and says okay, she texts saying shes sorry and that shes just in shock but is excited to see me.

50 minutes pass and she pulls in and walks to my car since she randomly pulls next to me. we just kind of laugh before I hug her and we quietly walk up to her dorm where we begin talking about everything.

She tells me while trying not to cry that she doesnt want me to deal with her and that she really likes me and feels like she will hurt me. In summary, we let some of our emotions out and end up cuddling again before we see her friends for a bit, she feels closer to me and more open now, I end up leaving and tell her thank you for not flat our rejecting me. I knew it was 50/50 but if what I felt like I knew about her was true, I knew she wouldn't reject seeing and talking to me in person.

As I drove home that night, I get pulled over for going 87 in a 70 by an officer and am hit with a $250 ticket. I get home around 2AM and tell her I miss her and begin to be super overbearing again. I tell her I got a ticket and Im sorry if Im waking her up and that if I ruined her image of me by getting a ticket since this was my first ever run in with the police and I didnt know what to do or say, all I could think about was how she would see me.

She waited up the 2 hours at night for me to get home safe and says I didnt ruin anything and that she really liked seeing me and to have a good sleep. I woke up and proceeded to text her goodmorning and thank you for not pushing me away and kept telling her how she makes me feel. I am a triple scorpio if anyone believes in or knows what that is and I am extremely ambitious and passionate but with that comes impatience and a great need for discipline while she is a virgo.

She relapses back to the hesitation and we text very lightly, just seems like we were friends and that she felt afraid that she was opening up to me and letting me in her life.

the week goes by and she tells me shes sorry I have to deal with her, that she really likes me and sees something with me and is afraid since shes never been treated nice in the past before. I try to hold myself back and just say its okay and that I care about her, we keep telling eachother through the week how much we mean to one another and how crazy it is that we just met.

We facetime on tuesday and she says she just wanted to talk about her feelings and we get really deep into our lives, where we want to be, how we feel about eachother, the whole shabang.

,depression,"I don’t quite know exactly what’s going on, I never been diagnosed. Maybe it’s because my mother takes it as a threat when I bring up therapy. Probably because she knows she is guilty and doesn’t want to be reminded. Eighteen years on this planet, and it feels like nothing has changed. The planet is still dying and gas prices are still going up, I have no control over what goes on in the world, the only thing I could control is my conscience. Yet it seems impossible to even do that. One good mental health week and almost instantly hit with the self doubt, insecurities, and the overwhelming idea of being lonely. I don’t want to be this way, I want to be better. I am overly self-aware of how mental health is, the way I react to things, the way I know what makes me feel bad, and if any of you are taking the time to read this you might be asking the question “if you know it’s bad, why do you do it?”  I can’t control it. I become aware of the thoughts but it’s this evil voice in my head making me believe that I am actually all of the negative things I think. When you constantly put yourself down, surround yourself with negative people, and have a toxic mother, you begin to feed into whatever they are saying. I don’t blame my mom, I am slowly forgiving her. I can’t stay  mad at her forever, she has also dealt with an overbearing emotionally abusive mother. But it’s so hard, there is no reciprocation. I am always wrong, she is always right. My feelings should be set aside, while hers are prioritized. This way of thinking has influenced all my past relationships. I attracted people who are hurt and wanted someone to walk all over to feel better. It’s tainted the way I view my self worth. Instead of understanding that my feelings are valid regardless of what anyone says, I come up with millions of reasons why the person making me feel bad is right. I am always the first to apologize even if I was not the one at fault. It’s this endless cycle, that I would do anything to stop. And there is way to stop it, through me.

,depression,"Hey, here the backstory to my problem but feel free to skip it and go down to the TL,DR section at the bottom

  
 I'm 28, still living at home and I've been unemployed for almost a year because of my depression and anxiety  
My family doesn't really understand since they're from the former Soviet Union so misery for them is just something you just gotta power through but unfortunately, I'm unable to do that and I hate living here because they make me feel like a weak fuckup

 A friend of mine knows this so she suggested that I'll move in with her and her boyfriend  
I told her not to give me hope because if it doesn't work out, I'll be truly lost  
I still did it because I had literally no other options and the new place made me feel better, although it still didn't fully ''cured'' me so I still had issues with finding a job or finding a way to close my debts  
I lived with them for the duration of the month of February and then she told me that they can't live with me since it's a strain on them which meant I had to go back home

 Feeling hopeless, I decided to slit my wrists but I didn't want to die sober so I drank 4\\5 of a bottle of rum, snorted 2 of her Wellbutrin pills and just passed out  
I woke up and realized that I'm still alive and I still have to move back home so I went to her and gave a hug, thanked her for trying to help and for some reason, I just broke down  
Went back to my room, drank what's left of the bottle and snorted another pill because I was gonna slit my wrists anyway but due to my weakened state (I couldn't stop sobbing hard or even stand up), I just managed to scratch my wrists

 Unbeknown to me, when I start breaking down, they called the paramedics and police  
When they arrived, I hid my arm with the sleeves of my jacket and sat up on my bed  
Being the gifted faker that I am, I mustered the power to just put on the best poker face I could and convinced them that's everything is cool  
Since no one knew I tried to kill myself, no one could take me by force to the mental hospital

 My friend used the ol' ""please do it for me"" and I agreed to check in the mental hospital and told them that I tried to commit suicide  
They checked me in and I realized that I don't belong there since it was less for people with depression and more for people with severe mental issues like schizophrenia and the like  
I'm maybe depressed and suicidal but I'm well aware of my surroundings and I have a clear mind so I was just stuck with people you couldn't even talk to  
Spent the night there, talked to the doctors in the morning and they just asked me if I think I belong there so I told them no  
They told me fair enough and released me, without even caring that I tried to kill myself or offer any help  
My friend came to pick me up and dropped me at my family's home (who have no idea that all of this went down) and later that day, dropped all my stuff from their apartment

4 people know about the whole deal which are that couple, another friend of mine and my ex-girlfriend  
You'd think that after trying to commit suicide and being in a place that makes me wanna do it even more, they'd come to visit me or at least call  
I tried telling her that I'm not gonna kill myself anytime soon but I'm planning on just rotting here and she told me only I can help myself  and told me to read a few self-help books that helped her  
The other friend, who texted me when I checked in the mental hospital, didn't talk to me since  
I tried reaching out to my ex and she told me it's too much for her to deal with

I'm not blaming any of them, depression is a motherfucker and it affects not only the sick person but the people around them too so it's extremely hard to deal with a depressed person  
I just resent the fact that they told me that I'm important to them and that they love me yet won't actually help me even when I do try reaching out or even telling them specifically what they can do to help me  
So now I'm praying I'll get a fatal disease, get killed somehow or OD because then it won't be ""my fault""  
I've tried taking Cipralex for a few months but it doesn't work at all and the side effects are too shitty so I stopped taking it a few days ago

&amp;#x200B;

TL,DR - Is it possible to help myself with my depression when I got no one who will help me, got no supporting family, no job and no faith in the mental health system?

,depression,"I am currently wallowing in my own self pity about things that I KNOW are not the end of the world. But I am unable to convince my subconscious of this. Yesterday, and honestly a lot of the days prior because I need to remind myself how blessed I am or this will happen faster, I was raving about how great my current situation is. I was viewing things from the perspective of how great things are and how much I have to look forward to. But instantaneously those feelings flipped on me today. I only have some semblance of an idea of what triggered this. I was listening to a podcast and they were discussing things they would like to do this summer.  I guess I couldn't handle the idea of somebody doing something I would miss out on, and I began to feel I had no way of keeping up. I want things to come to me effortlessly. I don't take into account that these people are at an entirely different stage of life than I am either. 

When a depressive mood sets in for me, I am unable to comprehend time. I no longer have the ability to understand that I can do so many things in my life because I'm only 23 and I have so much time to accomplish all of these things. But I guess the ""I am only__ years old thing"" is starting to wear on me. I have only been getting older when saying it without much to show for it. (Of course this isn't true, it's just the way I inexplicably feel).

 So when I start to think about the fact that I want to travel, or I want to make more friends, have more dates, whatever the case I begin to feel sad. I tell myself all the things that are holding me back from doing so. In my mind, I hate everyone and this is why I can't do this, I have dogs so I can't travel or really leave the house much, and finally it's because I am broke. Aside from me hating everyone, which is a deeper darker thing, the other two things just aren't true. So I really have no idea why I believe them. From this point, I began to nitpick every little thing about my life. Everything that I don't yet have that I feel for whatever reason I deserve. Everything that I have gone through that I feel is a negative is now amplified by 100 in my head. It began to eat away at me. I would like to have the opportunity to travel, I would like to have the opportunity to put myself first, I would like the opportunity to live a full life. This leads me down the rabbit hole of finding an issue with every single thing that exists in my life. Suddenly I wish the dogs weren't ""such a burden on me that I could travel"" though I know this isn't true and there are dozens of ways I could travel despite being a dog owner.

The hardest part is knowing that all of this is nonsense and on my good days I can poke holes in all of it.

Anyway, sorry if I couldn't condense it in a way that made a lot of sense. I really want to be vulnerable and share on here, because I know so many people go through similar things.

But I am unable to convince my subconscious of this. Yesterday, and honestly a lot of the days prior because I need to remind myself how blessed I am or this will happen faster, I was raving about how great my current situation is. I was viewing things from the perspective of how great things are and how much I have to look forward to. But instantaneously those feelings flipped on me today. I only have some semblance of an idea of what triggered this. I was listening to a podcast and they were discussing things they would like to do this summer.  I guess I couldn&amp;#39;t handle the idea of somebody doing something I would miss out on, and I began to feel I had no way of keeping up. I want things to come to me effortlessly. I don&amp;#39;t take into account that these people are at an entirely different stage of life than I am either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a depressive mood sets in for me, I am unable to comprehend time. I no longer have the ability to understand that I can do so many things in my life because I&amp;#39;m only 23 and I have so much time to accomplish all of these things. But I guess the &amp;quot;I am only__ years old thing&amp;quot; is starting to wear on me. I have only been getting older when saying it without much to show for it.

&lt;p&gt;So when I start to think about the fact that I want to travel, or I want to make more friends, have more dates, whatever the case I begin to feel sad. I tell myself all the things that are holding me back from doing so. In my mind, I hate everyone and this is why I can&amp;#39;t do this, I have dogs so I can&amp;#39;t travel or really leave the house much, and finally it&amp;#39;s because I am broke. Aside from me hating everyone, which is a deeper darker thing, the other two things just aren&amp;#39;t true. So I really have no idea why I believe them. From this point, I began to nitpick every little thing about my life. Everything that I don&amp;#39;t yet have that I feel for whatever reason I deserve. Everything that I have gone through that I feel is a negative is now amplified by 100 in my head. It began to eat away at me. I would like to have the opportunity to travel, I would like to have the opportunity to put myself first, I would like the opportunity to live a full life. This leads me down the rabbit hole of finding an issue with every single thing that exists in my life. Suddenly I wish the dogs weren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;such a burden on me that I could travel&amp;quot; though I know this isn&amp;#39;t true and there are dozens of ways I could travel despite being a dog owner.

This is gonna be crazy lengthy so please bear with me. I’m gonna try to label the sections in all caps so if anyone wants to skip around they can. Also I’m on mobile so I’m sorry for the formatting )-: 

INTRO: I (22f) attend a university in the US and am in a major where there’s only like 20 students in my “grade” (like freshman, sophomore, etc.) and we are all in the same classes together and have been for four years, so it’s hard to meet other people. We have all also had the same group of professors for four years. So we all are very familiar with each other. 
I’m a senior and it is my last semester, I graduate this May. The head of the department is very involved and is making sure that each of us individually are on the track to graduating. 

BACKGROUND: As a little background I have had severe anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I also have mild PTSD. I’m in a situation where my mom raised me by herself and was a great mom but also was incredibly verbally and emotionally abusive so I basically am terrified of confrontation, am a huge people pleaser, definitely do not do anything to stand out, and I follow directions and I do what I’m supposed to do (which is get decent grades, live independently and take care of my two pets, it just worked out that I work at a wonderful job that wants to take me on after I graduate, basically I’m just trying to be successful so my mom is proud of me). I have been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist actively and seeking treatment, but I have relapsed a handful of times. 

Throughout my college career, it never fails that at some point in the semester there is a week or two where I fall into a depression pit and get too anxious to leave home but I still complete my projects (my major is VERY project based) and have never missed a deadline. I have never failed a class before. During these times I have been quite open with specific professors because there is an attendance policy in place where you can have 3 unexcused absences and after that your grade is affected. I have spoken so far to 3 professors and they have all been super wonderful and empathetic and willing to work with me. 

For my senior project, I am as far along as everyone else and continue to produce work even though my mental health has been suffering recently. My studio professor got hired about a year ago give or take and we have never had him before as a professor so none of the seniors know him well. The senior studios are split up into two classrooms, so there are two professors but we are all working on our final projects. My professor is incredibly rude and snarky and has an attitude with everybody. He has called students incompetent and told one particular girl that she didn’t have the ability to become our profession. He yelled at another student in front of everyone before. His work load is insane and way more work than the other senior studio. Today they just turned in a deadline that we turned in two weeks ago. Not only does he want us to work on our senior project but he wants to throw all kinds of extra assignments in there when that’s not the point of the class. It’s to do our final thesis project. 

SITUATION: Recently I had missed a few weeks of school because I was going through intense shit with my mom, I was physically ill with the flu and then I got a sinus infection on top of that, but was keeping him updated. I got a note from an urgent care type place stating that I was ill with a flu like virus and I sent a picture of it to him in an email. I did not attend class the next day either because duh I have all the flu symptoms. I don’t think he counted that as excused because I didn’t get a note for that day, but I’m not going to pay $80 every day that I’m sick after they already prescribed me medicine and whatever just so I can get a note ???? 

So the following week goes by and I’m not getting any better and am getting more symptoms of a sinus infection. Great. Obviously I didn’t go to class. This is where I messed up because I should have gone to the doctor sooner to get an excuse I guess. 

I was emailing him and telling him that I wasn’t going to class and as we were just working on our projects for the upcoming deadline this literal entire time, I didn’t need to physically be there because I have the software I need for it on my laptop. So I am continuing to work on my project this whooole time. The deadline was that Friday and we were presenting in front of the class and a guest. I was still ill but sucked it up bc it was a presentation. I went to school early to print my project and my sweet boyfriend drove me because he knew I was having a hard time. So I didn’t bring my wallet. Big accident. I went to print my presentation at our printing lab(11 x 17 sheets) and after a freaking insane amount of time wasted because the front desk people weren’t there, I realized that they only take the school cash and my school ID was in my wallet at home. At this point class had already started and I was PANICKING. I could feel my face getting hot and my body shaking. I went outside to get some cool air but it did not help. I was having a panic attack and crying and hyperventilating. I called my boyfriend and said screw this come pick me up because I’m not going in empty handed to explain why I have no presentation while I’m full on sobbing in front of my peers and a guest. 

I did send him an email before I left and explained what happened. I was SO embarrassed. I profusely apologized, accepted a grade penalty, and explained my mental health issues because this had to do with that and I’ve been able to be open with professors of the same college before with no problem. He didn’t email me back ever, which I was like what the fuck because that was a serious email. 

So the next Monday I’m still feeling like shit so I go to the on campus doctor. I have a sinus infection, my ears are clogged so i can’t hear, snot is constantly falling from my nose, I’m constantly coughing. It’s gross. While I’m there I figure I will get a note to excuse last week. The doctor wrote that I was ill last week and the day that I came in, signed and dated it. I sent my professor this email to explain why I was so sick and again he didn’t answer me. 

Fast forward to a few days later and my antibiotics aren’t working. The doctor had prescribed me amoxicillin but I do better with augmentin. I should have mentioned that to him but it didn’t occur to me. I emailed him this note bc it was on the day of class and said my antibiotics are not working this is why I’m not in class. He did not respond for a third time and stated that I would be attending class that Friday. At this point I’m freaking out. He’s purposely ignoring me and I was still incredibly embarrassed and shameful about my panic attack at school so this was just making it worse. 

That Friday I did not go. I know I told him I would. But I can honestly say that I didn’t go because of how fucking anxious I was to see his reaction to me. 

I was a wreck the whole weekend. I cried so hard, had several panic attacks and it was overall not a fun time. My poor boyfriend was doing his best to try to comfort me. He is the only person I talk to other than my therapist. I don’t have any other friends because nobody in my major likes me because of the fact that I miss class a lot and am generally really quiet. My mom has told me its my fault they don’t like me. 

He actually ended up cancelling class on that Monday which was a relief for me! So I went on Wednesday. I talked to my therapist that morning and we had planned that I would go in at the start of class and bring him my notes and tell him I wanted to show him my project. I went to go pull out my laptop and pulled up my project to discuss it with him. He came up to me and asked me if these notes were the ones I emailed him. I said yes, I brought them because you never responded to me and I wanted to make sure you got them. He said with an attitude “well you have a lot of unexcused absences”. I started to say something but I only got out “I can-“ at which point he cut me off and said (while there were other students around bc we were at my desk) “I don’t know what you’re going to do but you’re not going to pass”, and this part is fuzzy because I was already blindsided at this point, but he said something to the effect of “and fix whatever else is going on” which I took personally as a jab at my mental health. and then walked away from me and proceeded to call another student up to him to discuss their project. 

I sat there in disbelief. What the fuck. Right? What the fuck? If I don’t pass this class I will not graduate. If I don’t graduate I lose my job. My family will be SO disappointed, especially my mother who is taking on debt for me to attend college. I sat there for a few minutes and tried to work. I could feel myself getting worked up and I could feel the panic coming. My eyes started watering and I had to get the fuck out of there.  I went outside and didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t call my boyfriend because I knew he was in an exam at the time. I tried calling my therapist but she didn’t answer which I totally understand because she’s super busy but I thought I would try anyways. 

I took a walk around campus to try to calm down but I eventually ended up behind some dumpsters sobbing and hyperventilating. I called my dad who I have a great relationship with now (not so much when I was younger) and he was really supportive, he talked to me until my boyfriend got out of his exam and could drive me home. 

I’m at a loss. I attended work the next day and broke down there. They sent me home. I spent the whole day hating myself and sobbing. I have one friend in my major who I consider a very close friend if not my best friend even if I’m not hers. We have been friends for 3 years and she knows almost every detail of my life. I told her about this and she said I needed to meet with the head of our major. She helped me organize my thoughts and write out an email and I sent it last night. 

Now it’s today and I woke up crying, I genuinely had for the first time suicidal thoughts. My head was pounding and I couldn’t stop obsessing over this. My therapist called me and talked with me for 10 minutes which I appreciate more than she will ever know. She literally talked me off the ledge, she called me while I was sobbing. 

Fast forward and I grew some balls and went to studio. I went straight to my desk and my friend who sits across from me completely ignored me. She didn’t look at me or anything even when I spoke to her directly (which was really only a little conversation but she avoided eye contact) So I just worked on my stuff the whole studio, which is 4 hours long. I wanted to just work on my project but something unexpected happened and my professor assigned an assignment that was due at the end of class, something that he never does. I think he did this bc he thought I wouldn’t be there today. He avoided looking at me the entire class and when he went around to everyone’s desks he went to mine last. Our assignment was to hand draw 5 separate detailed items of our project. He told us a specific example to use, which coincidentally I was already thinking of doing, so I drew it. He came over to me and told me he didn’t get why I put it there and what it has to do with anything. Then he went to the girl next to me and she was like “I don’t know what to draw” and he told her she could draw what I just fucking drew. At the end of class he went around again and spoke to everyone again once except me. 

And now here I am. I really don’t know what to do. I hate myself because I know this situation is my fault and I should have just gone to class. If you made it this far I really really appreciate it.

SITUATION: Recently I had missed a few weeks of school because I was going through intense shit with my mom, I was physically ill with the flu and then I got a sinus infection on top of that, but was keeping him updated. I got a note from an urgent care type place stating that I was ill with a flu like virus and I sent a picture of it to him in an email. I did not attend class the next day either because duh I have all the flu symptoms. I don’t think he counted that as excused because I didn’t get a note for that day, but I’m not going to pay $80 every day that I’m sick after they already prescribed me medicine and whatever just so I can get a note ???? 

So the following week goes by and I’m not getting any better and am getting more symptoms of a sinus infection. Great. Obviously I didn’t go to class. This is where I messed up because I should have gone to the doctor sooner to get an excuse I guess. 

I was emailing him and telling him that I wasn’t going to class and as we were just working on our projects for the upcoming deadline this literal entire time, I didn’t need to physically be there because I have the software I need for it on my laptop. So I am continuing to work on my project this whooole time. The deadline was that Friday and we were presenting in front of the class and a guest. I was still ill but sucked it up bc it was a presentation. I went to school early to print my project and my sweet boyfriend drove me because he knew I was having a hard time. So I didn’t bring my wallet. Big accident. I went to print my presentation at our printing lab(11 x 17 sheets) and after a freaking insane amount of time wasted because the front desk people weren’t there, I realized that they only take the school cash and my school ID was in my wallet at home. At this point class had already started and I was PANICKING. I could feel my face getting hot and my body shaking. I went outside to get some cool air but it did not help. I was having a panic attack and crying and hyperventilating. I called my boyfriend and said screw this come pick me up because I’m not going in empty handed to explain why I have no presentation while I’m full on sobbing in front of my peers and a guest. 

I did send him an email before I left and explained what happened. I was SO embarrassed. I profusely apologized, accepted a grade penalty, and explained my mental health issues because this had to do with that and I’ve been able to be open with professors of the same college before with no problem. He didn’t email me back ever, which I was like what the fuck because that was a serious email. 

So the next Monday I’m still feeling like shit so I go to the on campus doctor. I have a sinus infection, my ears are clogged so i can’t hear, snot is constantly falling from my nose, I’m constantly coughing. It’s gross. While I’m there I figure I will get a note to excuse last week. The doctor wrote that I was ill last week and the day that I came in, signed and dated it. I sent my professor this email to explain why I was so sick and again he didn’t answer me. 

Fast forward to a few days later and my antibiotics aren’t working. The doctor had prescribed me amoxicillin but I do better with augmentin. I should have mentioned that to him but it didn’t occur to me. I emailed him this note bc it was on the day of class and said my antibiotics are not working this is why I’m not in class. He did not respond for a third time and stated that I would be attending class that Friday. At this point I’m freaking out. He’s purposely ignoring me and I was still incredibly embarrassed and shameful about my panic attack at school so this was just making it worse. 

That Friday I did not go. I know I told him I would. But I can honestly say that I didn’t go because of how fucking anxious I was to see his reaction to me. 

I was a wreck the whole weekend. I cried so hard, had several panic attacks and it was overall not a fun time. My poor boyfriend was doing his best to try to comfort me. He is the only person I talk to other than my therapist. I don’t have any other friends because nobody in my major likes me because of the fact that I miss class a lot and am generally really quiet. My mom has told me its my fault they don’t like me. 

He actually ended up cancelling class on that Monday which was a relief for me! So I went on Wednesday. I talked to my therapist that morning and we had planned that I would go in at the start of class and bring him my notes and tell him I wanted to show him my project. I went to go pull out my laptop and pulled up my project to discuss it with him. He came up to me and asked me if these notes were the ones I emailed him. I said yes, I brought them because you never responded to me and I wanted to make sure you got them. He said with an attitude “well you have a lot of unexcused absences”. I started to say something but I only got out “I can-“ at which point he cut me off and said (while there were other students around bc we were at my desk) “I don’t know what you’re going to do but you’re not going to pass”, and this part is fuzzy because I was already blindsided at this point, but he said something to the effect of “and fix whatever else is going on” which I took personally as a jab at my mental health. and then walked away from me and proceeded to call another student up to him to discuss their project. 

I sat there in disbelief. What the fuck. Right? What the fuck? If I don’t pass this class I will not graduate. If I don’t graduate I lose my job. My family will be SO disappointed, especially my mother who is taking on debt for me to attend college. I sat there for a few minutes and tried to work. I could feel myself getting worked up and I could feel the panic coming. My eyes started watering and I had to get the fuck out of there.  I went outside and didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t call my boyfriend because I knew he was in an exam at the time. I tried calling my therapist but she didn’t answer which I totally understand because she’s super busy but I thought I would try anyways. 

I took a walk around campus to try to calm down but I eventually ended up behind some dumpsters sobbing and hyperventilating. I called my dad who I have a great relationship with now (not so much when I was younger) and he was really supportive, he talked to me until my boyfriend got out of his exam and could drive me home. 

I’m at a loss. I attended work the next day and broke down there. They sent me home. I spent the whole day hating myself and sobbing. I have one friend in my major who I consider a very close friend if not my best friend even if I’m not hers. We have been friends for 3 years and she knows almost every detail of my life. I told her about this and she said I needed to meet with the head of our major. She helped me organize my thoughts and write out an email and I sent it last night. 

Now it’s today and I woke up crying, I genuinely had for the first time suicidal thoughts. My head was pounding and I couldn’t stop obsessing over this. My therapist called me and talked with me for 10 minutes which I appreciate more than she will ever know. She literally talked me off the ledge, she called me while I was sobbing. 

Fast forward and I grew some balls and went to studio. I went straight to my desk and my friend who sits across from me completely ignored me. She didn’t look at me or anything even when I spoke to her directly (which was really only a little conversation but she avoided eye contact) So I just worked on my stuff the whole studio, which is 4 hours long. I wanted to just work on my project but something unexpected happened and my professor assigned an assignment that was due at the end of class, something that he never does. I think he did this bc he thought I wouldn’t be there today. He avoided looking at me the entire class and when he went around to everyone’s desks he went to mine last. Our assignment was to hand draw 5 separate detailed items of our project. He told us a specific example to use, which coincidentally I was already thinking of doing, so I drew it. He came over to me and told me he didn’t get why I put it there and what it has to do with anything. Then he went to the girl next to me and she was like “I don’t know what to draw” and he told her she could draw what I just fucking drew. At the end of class he went around again and spoke to everyone again once except me. 

And now here I am. I really don’t know what to do. I hate myself because I know this situation is my fault and I should have just gone to class. If you made it this far I really really appreciate it. I needed to get this out.Is my university professor bullying me or am I overreacting?"

I could get out of the house and get some exercise. All of these things came together and made me so hopeful about the future. I was having a good week - I even got my first art commission.

But of course the penny had to drop. She lied. Get your driving practice in? ""Not in my car you're not"". Get paid? ""why should I trust you to do anything? I'll figure it out myself."" It feels so hopeless. I'm trapped here. ""You're a horrible person. You don't have a heart or an ounce of compassion and you make life miserable"". I just wanted my license so I can get away.

,depression,"Hey all,
I am an international student studying film in the US. I recently graduated (in December) a semester before my class. I am on my OPT period under which I can stay in this country for 1 more year- if I get a job. 

I moved out of my roommates place in August 2019. I decided to live alone. Idk why I made that decision, but my life has been miserable since then. 

All the devilish thoughts, all my anger, self hatred, this disgusting LONELY feeling- all of these emotions that I had managed to suppress for 15 years, just started spewing out. 

For the first few days it was just in small batches- that I would feel horrible, but later it became every 3 days or 2 days kinda thing.

I’m gonna skip ahead in time and tell you how I feel now. I FEEL LIKE DOING NOTHING. 
I am a filmmaker, I used to love writing and making films. I don’t even know what I want to do anymore. I just sit around not being able to make a single successful decision in time. 

Not getting a job has really messed with my self image issues. I don’t like looking at myself sometimes. I feel very alone. I stay locked up in my apartment for the whole day. I feel like crying most of the time and I do it- I let my tears just flow until it pours uncontrollably. I have barely been getting any sleep.

I smoke weed and that makes me calm down a little. But now, IDK if that’s even a thing or just me trying to PLACEBO my own self. I recently googled “Do I have Depression”.  

My phone seems to think I have depression, I need to get help. But I don’t know how. I don’t know if I have depression or is it just me trying to find a reason why I am not good enough to get a job anymore.

,depression,"This was a mess, I can't think straight. I'm sorry.

Dec 2018 was when I last had suicidal thoughts. Got out of it (not fully, but for the most part).

 I've always been too good. I'm almost 22. Never been drunk (did weed once and it triggered my dpdr), never been kissed, obviously still a virgin. I hate it. I wish I hadn't been like that. Now I have issues with letting people really know me and getting close to mw, I don't even know myself. 

Started college July 2019 and things were looking up, but I don't know why I just can't be happy. For the past few weeks I started feeling off, I just feel so numb and sad and what the fuck? 

Yesterday I was at a small party, only friends... I can't open up to them even if I want to, I just can't tell them what I really feel. They were playing truth or dare and having fun but things were getting a little too much for me (lots of sexual questions and daring to kiss each other) so I just left. I couldn't handle it. And this morning I woke up crying... I just hate myself so, so much. It was just a group of friends having fun, and I wanted to socialize because I truly care about them but I just couldn't do it.

I shouldn't be here. I'm annoying, I'm ridiculous, things would be better if I wasn't here. But I'm too scared to kill myself.

And I knew this was coming, I don't know why but I could just feel depression crawling back in and today I finally broke down.

I'm sorry.

Dec 2018 was when I last had suicidal thoughts. Got out of it (not fully, but for the most part).

 I've always been too good. I'm almost 22. Never been drunk (did weed once and it triggered my dpdr), never been kissed, obviously still a virgin. I hate it. I wish I hadn't been like that. Now I have issues with letting people really know me and getting close to mw, I don't even know myself. 

Started college July 2019 and things were looking up, but I don't know why I just can't be happy. For the past few weeks I started feeling off, I just feel so numb and sad and what the fuck? 

Yesterday I was at a small party, only friends... I can't open up to them even if I want to, I just can't tell them what I really feel. They were playing truth or dare and having fun but things were getting a little too much for me (lots of sexual questions and daring to kiss each other) so I just left. I couldn't handle it.

,depression,"So I’m just gonna tell you my story.

I’ve felt extremely depressed for the past year and a half or so, ever since my dad died to a heart condition in October of 2018. Flash forward to now, and I’m still like I am, but I feel it’s worse. For one, my family is in very bad shape in terms of finances, especially due to the fact that my mother and father had a baby before he died. So it’s becoming difficult to pay for anything we need, like food, clothes, etc.. 

On the family side of things, most of us are just divided. Fights have broken out, causing some of us to just not show up to family gatherings anymore. It doesn’t really help that I wasn’t exactly close to any of them in the first place. I just feel like I’m caught in the middle of it all. And I feel hopeless because I have absolutely no clue how to help, nor do I think I can.

On the personal side, I just have this deep, severe hatred for myself now. Not only does feeling like this leave me tired and I just have no drive to do anything anymore, even the things I normally enjoy, but it gets really bad sometimes because I sometimes think that I wanna kill myself, and that the world would be better off without me. That the pain would finally end. On top of all that, I’m CONSTANTLY bullied, online and in real life, for enjoying the things that I do, or I just get bullied in general. I also struggle to make friends, because I feel extremely insecure. Most of the kids at my school are super popular, and I’m just this socially anxious, insecure kid in the corner. People tell me to have confidence and people will like me, but it doesn’t work. When I try to be confident and tell jokes and stuff, it leads to people calling me weird, laughing insultingly, or just being silent. Even the friends I do have do this sometimes. My best friend in the whole world (he has always had my back and never once insults me or anything, he just constantly tries to help me out) moved away and I never get to see him anymore.

I’m super sorry for the long explanation, I just really wanna feel better, but I keep losing hope by the minute. I feel like there is zero chance for me to get better. The only chance I have, in my eyes, is for this to all get progressively worse.

,depression,"Recently stopped a  depression med with my psychiatrist's permission. My symptoms immediately improved. Had been on antidepressants since 14; I'm 26 now. I initially did great after quitting the med, but taking stock of life has been a bummer.

I hate the (admittedly lucrative) field I'll be working in, but that doesn't bother me so much. I hate being an adult and not having the social skills to make new friends or have romantic relationships. I hate the vicious cycle of social isolation and social anxiety. I hate knowing that I missed out on years of essential social development. 

There are two things that really bother me about this. 

First, it's my fault. Men have tried to be friends with me (even recently), women have shown interest in me (not so much anymore lmao), but I just ignored them and wasted my life reading nonfiction books that serve no use beyond bringing a conversation to a halt as fast as possible. Why? First because of depression. Then because I had  isolated myself enough to have social anxiety. Now because I never learned how to have healthy friendships, much less flirt with women. All avoidable. 

Second, it feels like it's over. I didn't have experiences that can only happen at certain times in your life. I've passed the point where being socially incompetent is acceptable. It's fucked and I can't unfuck it. My future coworkers are largely in serious relationships or married. I feel like a child talking to them. They have preexisting friend groups, often near work. I have neither, and I already have a reputation for being weird and antisocial.

,depression,"Hey,

So I don't really know where to begin with this but recently I've been feeling like everything is pointless and I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing. I feel like I'm living to work and most of the time I'm waking up early, working all day, getting home and by the time I've had dinner and done the washing up I'm too tired to be bothered to do anything.

Every time I try to pursue a hobby I quickly lose interest or get bored. I like boxing so sometimes go to an amateur boxing club near me. Even though the coaches are nice guys, the quality of training isn't great. I know I shouldn't expect too much because it's super cheap like £5 for 3 hour and a half sessions a week but I can't afford much else and don't particularly enjoy it or feel I'm making progress. Before I moved in with my girlfriend and her family I used to go to another boxing club. I much preferred it there - I really liked the coaches, the structure of the sessions and there was a good sense of camaraderie; I made a few friends there but it's too far to travel now. Besides, my parents didn't like me going there because I had a few white collar bouts and admittedly I'm not very good at boxing so I won once but got quite badly beaten up twice and ended up needing a brain scan in hospital. It goes back to this feeling of futility because even though I enjoy it what is the point if I'm not very good? At one point I was going 5 or 6 times a week and I still wasn't great.

I also like music (going to gigs and playing guitar), running, weightlifting, football (soccer), reading and paying my Nintendo Switch. But recently none of these have been holding my attention and I've been losing interest really quickly. For example I start learning to play a song on guitar and don't get round to practicing for a few days so forget it and move on to another song. I'll start trying to run 2 or 3 times a week to improve my 5k time then I'll be lazy and not bother for 2 weeks. I've been getting better with the weightlifting but similarly I'll miss a few sessions and feel like I'm back at square one. With football I'm so disinterested I won't even watch my team play or bother catching the highlights. With reading I won't get past the first few chapters of a book, and even with playing my Nintendo Switch I'll start a game and get bored.

I feel like any hobby I pick up is pointless and I'm never going to get anywhere with it because I started too late (I'm 23 now). As well, my girlfriend and I are trying to put aside £500 each a month to save for our own house so that makes it hard to afford to be a part of any clubs or do anything outside of work. 

I've really tried to make an effort to sort myself out by writing lists, setting goals, reminders and etc. but then my whole life feels like a tick-box exercise and as soon as I miss a day I feel like I have to start over from the beginning. It's becoming all too easy to take days off, eat junk food, binge social media, YouTube and porn.

I feel really silly coming out and saying all of this because I'm fit, healthy, I've got a good job, a few good friends, a loving and supportive girlfriend and all of her family are great too but I just can't help feeling that I'm going through the motions everyday. I've mentioned the way I've been feeling briefly to my girlfriend and she's tried to help bless her but I don't want to talk about it too much with her or her family because they've got enough on their plates with some of them having depression / anxiety already.

I feel like I'm living to work and most of the time I'm waking up early, working all day, getting home and by the time I've had dinner and done the washing up I'm too tired to be bothered to do anything.

Every time I try to pursue a hobby I quickly lose interest or get bored. I like boxing so sometimes go to an amateur boxing club near me. Even though the coaches are nice guys, the quality of training isn't great. I know I shouldn't expect too much because it's super cheap like £5 for 3 hour and a half sessions a week but I can't afford much else and don't particularly enjoy it or feel I'm making progress. Before I moved in with my girlfriend and her family I used to go to another boxing club. I much preferred it there - I really liked the coaches, the structure of the sessions and there was a good sense of camaraderie; I made a few friends there but it's too far to travel now. Besides, my parents didn't like me going there because I had a few white collar bouts and admittedly I'm not very good at boxing so I won once but got quite badly beaten up twice and ended up needing a brain scan in hospital. It goes back to this feeling of futility because even though I enjoy it what is the point if I'm not very good? At one point I was going 5 or 6 times a week and I still wasn't great.

I also like music (going to gigs and playing guitar), running, weightlifting, football (soccer), reading and paying my Nintendo Switch. But recently none of these have been holding my attention and I've been losing interest really quickly. For example I start learning to play a song on guitar and don't get round to practicing for a few days so forget it and move on to another song. I'll start trying to run 2 or 3 times a week to improve my 5k time then I'll be lazy and not bother for 2 weeks. I've been getting better with the weightlifting but similarly I'll miss a few sessions and feel like I'm back at square one. With football I'm so disinterested I won't even watch my team play or bother catching the highlights. With reading I won't get past the first few chapters of a book, and even with playing my Nintendo Switch I'll start a game and get bored.

I feel like any hobby I pick up is pointless and I'm never going to get anywhere with it because I started too late (I'm 23 now). As well, my girlfriend and I are trying to put aside £500 each a month to save for our own house so that makes it hard to afford to be a part of any clubs or do anything outside of work. 

I've really tried to make an effort to sort myself out by writing lists, setting goals, reminders and etc. but then my whole life feels like a tick-box exercise and as soon as I miss a day I feel like I have to start over from the beginning. It's becoming all too easy to take days off, eat junk food, binge social media, YouTube and porn.

I feel really silly coming out and saying all of this because I'm fit, healthy, I've got a good job, a few good friends, a loving and supportive girlfriend and all of her family are great too but I just can't help feeling that I'm going through the motions everyday. I've mentioned the way I've been feeling briefly to my girlfriend and she's tried to help bless her but I don't want to talk about it too much with her or her family because they've got enough on their plates with some of them having depression / anxiety already.

Anyway, thank you to anyone that's read this and I hope someone can help.Feel very apathetic and that everything I do is futile"
,depression,"It started a few months ago. I’m 24 years old. I was driving home from work feeling perfectly fine and then I felt this weird numb sensation on the left side of my chest. It’s been multiple months and it hasn’t gone away. I also feel lightheaded and just bad all the time. This is the worst I’ve ever felt in my life, and the worst year of my life by far. I’m completely sober now also, I used to vape thc oil a lot. 

I thought it was a lung problem related to vaping this MCT oil I used for the first time. But I’ve been to many doctors and had many tests and they all say they can’t find anything wrong with me and they think it’s mental. I’m considering starting medication even though I’m still not convinced this is 100% mental. I don’t even know what to do anymore. May look for in person support groups. My parents just screamed at me for not going out recently and said I was in “solitary confinement” every weekend. I wish I could go out like I  used to. I never thought anything like this would happen to me. 

I literally feel like I’m living on a different dimension than the last 23 years of my life. But it developed so suddenly, I was perfectly fine one minute, then “depressed” the next minute for no reason. Is that even possible. Has anyone experienced anything like this before?

,depression,"  I’ve been fighting, and fighting, and trying to understand, and trying to be understood, and I just…I can’t anymore.  I can’t.  I’ve tried so hard.  But everything, everything has been hard, and against me, right from the start.  I’ve never belonged anywhere, not even in my own family.  How many times they would say “Oh, that’s just how she is,” as if there was no other way to describe how other I was from the people who raised me.  I was so different from my parents, who had been raised in a single town, in a community, all their lives, with their sense of heritage and culture.  I was what I now know as a “third culture child.”  My siblings were third culture children too, but I was third culture from them, as well.  I was the only one who was born of a different parent.  They were all half siblings who got plenty attention from, and took after my stepfather, while he never spoke to me.  And my mother, who had remarried just to be able to support me, was secretly miserable and depressed, and never had the time or energy to speak to me either.  I was left to entertain myself in my room, constantly, and just shrugged off as unfathomable whenever I tried to talk to my parents.  No matter what age I was, from birth, to childhood, to adolescence, and now, adulthood; I’ve been forced to be alone, as we moved over and over again.  I was always alone, save for one point in my life, for a very short period of time.  I finally had a group of friends in middle school.  The one time I got to stay in a community for any significant length of time.  It was the happiest I had ever been.  When it was taken away from me, and we had to move again, that was my first major depression.  And I’ve just never recovered.  Ever since then, I’ve tried to find my home in other people.  I’ve tried to find that place again.  And again, and again, it’s fallen apart.  I can’t take the loneliness anymore.  My new partner is my last hope.  The last one.  Haven’t I said this before?  But I can feel it this time.  That if he betrays me, if this falls apart, I will die.  Even now, I’m terrified.  I feel like just resigning myself to the fact that it’s going to go the same as all the others, and just giving up, before he deals me the killing blow.  Because I don’t want to feel it.  Better to surrender now, while I still have a small piece of my sanity left, give him the baby, and just leave and never bother anyone again.  I wanted to find my place, but I’m learning over and over again, that no matter how hard I try, I’m too different, I’m too weak, and there’s just no place for me in a society that’s opposite of everything I stand for.  So instead of being told constantly how naïve and immature I am because I can’t be the way society wants me to be to survive, and burdening everyone by trying to be happy amongst them, just let me disappear.  It feels so different this time…he feels like the other half of me.  We’re so alike.  He understands me, and my point of view, but really, what does that say, accept that we’re going to be unaccepted by society together?  We’ll fail to provide for our child.  I don’t want our love to die because of the pressure society puts on us.  I don’t want how little we can do to make it, to cause resentment between us.  I want to remember our love as it is now, where you’re my soulmate, and you think I’m perfect.  I don’t want you to think I’m worthless like everyone else does… I don’t want you to take another child from me…  My beautiful sweet child, who my ex-husband took from me, was able to take from me, because I can’t find my place in society and make the money it takes to keep her…  Money.  Always.  The bond between a mother and her child, takes no precedence over money.  I felt it, from the time I had to give her to daycare, so I could try to go back to school, or work…she wasn’t really mine, she was the government’s.  She was another wage slave I had given them, and now I had to go back to being the wage slave I was, to even earn the privilege to be with her.  My role as her mother, the fact that I had created her and carried her in my body for the better part of a year, that she was part of ME, didn’t count for anything.  The family I dreamed of building, the home I dreamed of finally having a place to belong in, my marriage, it was all destroyed, by lack of money, lack of place in society.  My husband didn’t care about our love, more than he cared that I couldn’t fit in his culture.  Naïve person that I am, I thought that I would have priority over that.  In the end, I didn’t even have priority over his video games.  But I had faith in him.  I thought surely, with how earnestly I loved him, and listened to him, that he would see my value, for the things that really mattered, not my value to society, not my value as a wage earner.  I made the mistake of thinking that was a natural way to think, because that was the way I thought.  I’m so stupid.  I thought the same thing, back when my sociopath in high school discarded me.  I thought, surely, if he ever loved me, he couldn’t be so heartless.  I’ve given him all of my love unconditionally.  Surely, he sees that and understands the value of that.  But no, he threw me away, like none of it had ever meant anything in the first place.  But still, for some unexplicable reason, I still believe in people.  I still have faith, over, and over again.  I have faith now.  I have a baby in my stomach with a man I believe is my soulmate.  It’s not the same this time, I say.  Because my faith never dies, even if I wish it would, so they would stop hurting me.  Instead, I’m at my final round, because if it happens again, I will die.  Part of me isn’t even afraid to die.  Just let it be over.  Stop dangling the carrot.  Just kill me.  No one thinks like I do.  I don’t belong here anyway.  Just kill me.  I just wish, someone would tell me, that God himself, would have enough mercy to tell me, that there’s nothing wrong with me.  That society is just backwards, and has lost it’s way, putting money and work and culture and borders before everything that’s actually important.  Family, love, friendship, happiness, fulfillment, enlightenment, spirituality…that I’m actually the only one that’s right, and I’ve been unjustly persecuted.  Just tell me, at the moment of my death, that I did nothing wrong, that I’m perfect just the way I am.  Please.  Take me to the place I really belong.  I won’t commit suicide, if it’s really such a bad thing to do, that will keep me from that place, but I’ve done

 We’ll fail to provide for our child.  I don’t want our love to die because of the pressure society puts on us.  I don’t want how little we can do to make it, to cause resentment between us.  I want to remember our love as it is now, where you’re my soulmate, and you think I’m perfect.  I don’t want you to think I’m worthless like everyone else does… I don’t want you to take another child from me…  My beautiful sweet child, who my ex-husband took from me, was able to take from me, because I can’t find my place in society and make the money it takes to keep her…  Money.  Always.  The bond between a mother and her child, takes no precedence over money.  I felt it, from the time I had to give her to daycare, so I could try to go back to school, or work…she wasn’t really mine, she was the government’s.  She was another wage slave I had given them, and now I had to go back to being the wage slave I was, to even earn the privilege to be with her.  My role as her mother, the fact that I had created her and carried her in my body for the better part of a year, that she was part of ME, didn’t count for anything.  The family I dreamed of building, the home I dreamed of finally having a place to belong in, my marriage, it was all destroyed, by lack of money, lack of place in society.  My husband didn’t care about our love, more than he cared that I couldn’t fit in his culture.  Naïve person that I am, I thought that I would have priority over that.  In the end, I didn’t even have priority over his video games.  But I had faith in him.  I thought surely, with how earnestly I loved him, and listened to him, that he would see my value, for the things that really mattered, not my value to society, not my value as a wage earner.  I made the mistake of thinking that was a natural way to think, because that was the way I thought.  I’m so stupid.  I thought the same thing, back when my sociopath in high school discarded me.  I thought, surely, if he ever loved me, he couldn’t be so heartless.  I’ve given him all of my love unconditionally.  Surely, he sees that and understands the value of that.  But no, he threw me away, like none of it had ever meant anything in the first place.  But still, for some unexplicable reason, I still believe in people.  I still have faith, over, and over again.  I have faith now.  I have a baby in my stomach with a man I believe is my soulmate.  It’s not the same this time, I say.  Because my faith never dies, even if I wish it would, so they would stop hurting me.  Instead, I’m at my final round, because if it happens again, I will die.  Part of me isn’t even afraid to die.  Just let it be over.  Stop dangling the carrot.  Just kill me.  No one thinks like I do.  I don’t belong here anyway.  Just kill me.  I just wish, someone would tell me, that God himself, would have enough mercy to tell me, that there’s nothing wrong with me.  That society is just backwards, and has lost it’s way, putting money and work and culture and borders before everything that’s actually important.  Family, love, friendship, happiness, fulfillment, enlightenment, spirituality…that I’m actually the only one that’s right, and I’ve been unjustly persecuted.  Just tell me, at the moment of my death, that I did nothing wrong, that I’m perfect just the way I am.  Please.  Take me to the place I really belong.  I won’t commit suicide, if it’s really such a bad thing to do, that will keep me from that place, but I’ve done everything I can do.  Just come for me in the night, and take me home.Take Me Home"

,depression,"Hey Everyone,

For what I can see, I have a pretty decent life. Got a good family, got a good job ect. I just cannot shake this feeling of utter emptiness. 

I have tried all sorts to give my life meaning, but no matter what I do, I just feel hopeless. I am pretty sure that no-one I know would assume that I feel this way as I am quite social and have quite a few friends. Deep down though, I feel low value and worthless.

The one area of life that I struggle with is romantically. I have never been in a serious relationship and I am 26 (M). For some reason, I just cannot get this area sorted and I do not understand women at all. Maybe I'm a little bit autistic or something.

I am training hard for a very intense job atm and I am struggling to find a reason to go on. I have abused alcohol heavily in the past and it has gotten me into some shady situations. I thought giving it up would be good for me, but I still feel this loneliness.

I sometimes even have suicidal thoughts even though I would never act on it.

I moved schools bc even though there wasn’t anything to bad with my school I read a lot of things saying anxiety can be caused by the school ur at. So I moved. BIG MISTAKE.

,depression,"I have a group of friends I've kept in contact with from high school, and we all just graduated college. Fortunately for me, everyone moved to the major city where I attended college and decided to stay. We've mentioned how fortunate and lucky we are that all four of us stayed in touch, actually liked one another in high school, and up to now in the beginning of our young adult lives, but sometimes I feel like the odd man out. 

Like last night, I saw that the three of them went out, and I didn't get the invite, which was fine. But then this morning, our group text was used to talk about brunch plans and everyone was chiming in, which is great. Except the last text in the group before that was me trying to make brunch plans and nobody answered, which makes me feel like nobody wants to hang out if I'm the one initiating plans. Then, they started talking about things that happened last night, and so when I finally just said ""I'm lost,"" one of them explained the situation to me and said that it was an ""impromptu meetup."" 

I may just be overanalyzing this, but the only ways I see the impromptu meetup happening are if they individually texted each other and just didn't want to invite me or that there's a separate group text where I'm left out. It just really stinks because I genuinely think of these guys as my best friends, and I was so excited to have them here in my city.

It's selfish to say, but with this happening, it feels less like my city to me and more like theirs where I'm a side character. 

It feels like I'm the back-up friend when it's convenient.It sucks being the back-up friend"

,depression,"I haven’t had a major depressive episode in three years. When I was depressed, I had three dreams about suicide, and each of them shook me up and I’ll never forget them. Lately, I’ve been having some signs of relapse creeping in which have been haunting me, and yesterday I had a nightmare about suicide which really messed me up.

In the dream, it was a sunny day and I was outside my fraternity house where some of the other brothers were hanging out, all laughing and smiling and having a great time. There was a group of my other friends there, none of whom were in my fraternity, and I went to go hang out with them; but one of them kept making jokes about ending her life when she was serious (in real life she’s not depressed or remotely mentally ill at all so I don’t know why I conjured this up). She was saying stuff like “well when I jump off a bridge this won’t matter” and everyone was laughing, but I burst into tears in the dream because she was one of my favorite friends and I couldn’t stand the thought of her suffering. To make matters worse, I was having thoughts of suicide myself in the dream. One of the other people in the group looked at me while I was crying and asked, “what’s wrong?” and I said “because none of these people around me will be here after I end my life.”

Then I started thinking about the pain of suicide in the dream, thinking about the anguish that people’s parents, siblings, friends, and lovers must feel when they think they could’ve done something to stop it and they start to blame themselves. I said to myself “I hate thinking about suicide” and cried even harder, and then I “woke up” in the dream (but not actually in real life). Then after I woke up from that dream into another dream, I was suddenly in my best friend’s house traumatized from that dream I had. I was going to see my girlfriend soon, but I was still depressed from that dream and started getting mad at myself for not being happy and thinking about ending my life even though I have her.

,depression," For a long time, I did not feel sad about feeling sad because, you see, I could identify as a raging feminist, a fierce writer, a music connoisseur. But out of all these, I identified as a sad person. I’ve dreaded introductory classes for as long as I can remember because when the professor asks me to introduce myself to the class, all I really want to say is that I’m morose and that is all there is to know about me.


If I had to, I couldn’t pinpoint to a particular day on which this began. One day, I felt deeply sad. The next day, I felt the same. Since the “bracing up” was becoming a lot of work , I wanted to get it over with. So,I Iooked into what more was in store for me. Before I knew, I started making room for sadness . I curled up till I acclimatized to it. Gradually, it started to feel like home and the thing about home is that there is no need to leave at all. 


 On one occasion, I sat bleary-eyed through an entire night to perfect a presentation I was looking forward to work on for months. When I was called up to present it the next day , I rushed through it half-heartedly and murmured an apology to the professor. I had seen my colleagues beaming with pride so many times after being lauded for their commendable jobs. I couldn’t recall the last time I felt that way. So when the opportunity came, I was too scared to feel something this foreign. What if it felt nothing out of the ordinary? What if I wasn’t cut out for this kind of satisfaction? After all, chasing happiness had left me so depleted that I couldn’t feel it like others. 


My colleagues told me to be brave and see a therapist. I didn’t want to be brave because being brave means trying to heal. While everybody tells you about the magical powers of healing, nobody tells you about how much unlearning is required in the process. Unlearning years of self deprecating behaviour for someone whose answer to everything has been self -sabotage is exhausting itself. 

You see, sadness comes with an evolutionary period and with me, it always made healing lag behind. I knew the very things I needed to do to come out of the abyss. But, more than often, I couldn’t do it out of fear of uneasiness for change, or worse, no change at all. What if sadness was the most palpable aspect of my life and I was as much a goner without it as much as I was with it? Imagine going through years of emotional labour in therapy only to discover that you amount to nothing without your suffering. 

My purpose here is not to glorify sadness or mental illness in any form. I do not intend to justify destructive behaviour by means of this either. I just want to represent everyone who eludes happiness more often than happiness eludes them. I haven’t figured the way out of this but I learn everyday. I learn and unlearn. I learn how I’m wired and I’m not ready to stop yet. I want you to be patient with yourself . But, it is important that you do it EVERYDAY because you know very well that sadness thrives even when you are oblivious to it.",t2_5a82q2ok,False,,0,False,Sadness as an identity and a routine is less talked about.

&lt;p&gt;On one occasion, I sat bleary-eyed through an entire night to perfect a presentation I was looking forward to work on for months. When I was called up to present it the next day , I rushed through it half-heartedly and murmured an apology to the professor. I had seen my colleagues beaming with pride so many times after being lauded for their commendable jobs. I couldn’t recall the last time I felt that way. So when the opportunity came, I was too scared to feel something this foreign. What if it felt nothing out of the ordinary? What if I wasn’t cut out for this kind of satisfaction? After all, chasing happiness had left me so depleted that I couldn’t feel it like others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My colleagues told me to be brave and see a therapist. I didn’t want to be brave because being brave means trying to heal. While everybody tells you about the magical powers of healing, nobody tells you about how much unlearning is required in the process. Unlearning years of self deprecating behaviour for someone whose answer to everything has been self -sabotage is exhausting itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, sadness comes with an evolutionary period and with me, it always made healing lag behind. I knew the very things I needed to do to come out of the abyss. But, more than often, I couldn’t do it out of fear of uneasiness for change, or worse, no change at all. What if sadness was the most palpable aspect of my life and I was as much a goner without it as much as I was with it? Imagine going through years of emotional labour in therapy only to discover that you amount to nothing without your suffering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My purpose here is not to glorify sadness or mental illness in any form. I do not intend to justify destructive behaviour by means of this either. I just want to represent everyone who eludes happiness more often than happiness eludes them. I haven’t figured the way out of this but I learn everyday. I learn and unlearn. I learn how I’m wired and I’m not ready to stop yet. I want you to be patient with yourself . But, it is important that you do it EVERYDAY because you know very well that sadness thrives even when you are oblivious to it.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Its Saturday. Its a beautiful day out. There are things that I can think of to do and go.

I feel completely overwhelmed and paralyzed from my emotions. The past 2 hours I was laying in bed with my eyes closed trying to pass out or to stop thinking. I am constantly thinking of killing myself. I'm constantly thinking of what validates me to be alive.  I think purpose is self prescribed; but every day since I was young I keep hold on this existential shame and want to kill myself. I stop explainging that I'm upset to people other than just saying that I'm depressed. I wish that I didnt exist. I have been having disassociative feelings where I'm outside of my physical body watching a movie play in from my experiences for the past couple years. Things always feel like they get worse and more hopeless. 

I started doing things that I feel like are somewhat close to self mutilation but I feel too ashamed to describe to anyone. I started therapy a year ago because I keep thinking of killing myself and I begin to plan out how I need to do it to make sure it gets done instead of trying to find what good there may be in life.

I'm 33 years old. I see younger teens on here and some other ages too.  I have a lot of good things in life but they don't really 'mean' anything to me.  I have a job and enough money to live in a small apartment.  I don't feel like I have friends that I can really talk to and I get further from my family all of the time.

I'm just waiting to die everyday.  I wake up and fall asleep thinking that I shouldn't be alive.  When people describe to me what makes life worthwhile to them it doesn't make sense to me. 

I just want everything to fade to black. No more experiences.  I want to return to nothing - that's where I belong.  I feel like I'm crying but no tears come out.  Just this sinking inside of me and a soft shudder within my chest like quiet sobbing. 

I'm also bummed because my therapist (an intern who has been pretty good at describing emotional intelligence and helping me understand how to describe some things better) is going to possibly stop meeting me and she said she might refer me to a different therapist. Not the end of the world, but still sad to think of this person that I've been explaining my sadness to.

Its a beautiful day out. There are things that I can think of to do and go.

I feel completely overwhelmed and paralyzed from my emotions. The past 2 hours I was laying in bed with my eyes closed trying to pass out or to stop thinking. I am constantly thinking of killing myself. I'm constantly thinking of what validates me to be alive.  I think purpose is self prescribed; but every day since I was young I keep hold on this existential shame and want to kill myself. I stop explainging that I'm upset to people other than just saying that I'm depressed. I wish that I didnt exist. I have been having disassociative feelings where I'm outside of my physical body watching a movie play in from my experiences for the past couple years. Things always feel like they get worse and more hopeless. 

I started doing things that I feel like are somewhat close to self mutilation but I feel too ashamed to describe to anyone. I started therapy a year ago because I keep thinking of killing myself and I begin to plan out how I need to do it to make sure it gets done instead of trying to find what good there may be in life.

I'm 33 years old. I see younger teens on here and some other ages too.  I have a lot of good things in life but they don't really 'mean' anything to me.  I have a job and enough money to live in a small apartment.  I don't feel like I have friends that I can really talk to and I get further from my family all of the time.

I'm just waiting to die everyday.  I wake up and fall asleep thinking that I shouldn't be alive.  When people describe to me what makes life worthwhile to them it doesn't make sense to me. 

I just want everything to fade to black. No more experiences.  I want to return to nothing - that's where I belong.  I feel like I'm crying but no tears come out.  Just this sinking inside of me and a soft shudder within my chest like quiet sobbing. 

I'm also bummed because my therapist (an intern who has been pretty good at describing emotional intelligence and helping me understand how to describe some things better) is going to possibly stop meeting me and she said she might refer me to a different therapist. Not the end of the world, but still sad to think of this person that I've been explaining my sadness to.

,depression,"Hey everyone,

I would really love to hear some first hand experiences, because I am in a terrible place right now.

I have suffered from depression for decades. I am currently taking 40mg Paroxetine for depression(about 4 years) and 10mg (3x) of dextroamphetamine(about 2 years, not everyday).

 If I don't take  the dextroamphetamine I suffer from severe lethargy, hollowness, lack of interest in almost all of the activities I am passionate about, horrible absence of sex drive and just a general ambivalent disposition about everything. The Paroxetine has helped tremendously with my obsessive thoughts, my insomnia and some aspects of my general anxiety; however, I cannot continue living life with this feeling of complete lack of passion and drive.

I don't want to be on dexedrine any longer as it's effects are dwindling and so I am thinking about trying Wellbutrin. I'm hoping that it will, to some extent, help with the lethargy and help negate some of the numbed feelings of Paroxetine. 

I understand that it is a DNRI, and I believe I understand it's pharmacological action. I know it won't give me the alertness that dextroamphetamine does, and that's fine. I just want to have my feelings of excitement, sexual intrigue, and interest in more than sleeping and staying inside the house. 

I know everyone is different, but please, has anyone went from amphetamines to wellbutrin and how was your experience? Any help would be greatly appreciated, I feel like I'm completely stuck.

,depression,"My life. (I know, my jokes are lame af)
But seriously tho, DISCLAIMER: I’m sorry if you clicked on this wanted to find something funny but there’s actually nothing here.
The thing is, I’ve been unmotivated and ambitionless for white a longggg while now. And I don’t see the day that I become ambition at all. 
So because of that, I’ve been avoid dating a lottt. You know, it’s just... I don’t want to drag anyone down with me in the darkness. But I still feel very lonely and really needs someone since I’ve been alone for my entire life now. I haven’t had ANY dates since the day I was born and that makes me reallly craving for the feels that it will bring, maybe even giving me some motivation for god sake. But yeaaaaaa.... noooo.
So even though I’m still not planning on dating anyone. I still want to feel a tini tiny bit better so I went on google and searched for “should ambtionless date” in hoping of some pages popping up saying “yes don’t feel bad” or something like “yes there are people who accepts you” .

,depression,"I have never wanted children but I can't help but thinking about how the older I get I will just get to watch my family grow old and die until I'm all alone. It makes me second guess myself and think maybe I should have children, that I;ll regret it if I don't. But it seems like a terrible reason not helped by the fact that I whilst I will miss my family once they're gone I don't actually enjoy spending time with them now.

I am a bad person. I am condescending, get jealous of other’s success even if they are my best friends, try to bring people down. 
I don’t like it about myself. I want to be happy about other’s success and help them but I always feel jealous and wish they wouldn’t succeed. I always get a feeling of superiority  when helping people and I hate that feeling but I can’t do anything about it. I am very pessimistic and always assume people are gonna betray me and I think it’s because I’d betray them if the positions are reversed.

,depression,"I'm a freshman in college. I feel sad all the time. Even sometimes when I'm with people who should make me happy. I've lost all my confidence from many things, but mainly being bullied by others growing up and my parents divorcing and their conflicts for 6 years while I was living with both of them.

,depression,I haven’t cared for a while but wasn’t always truly not caring. Now I’m at the point we’re i truly 100% couldn’t care less if I lived of died. I have no idea what I’m doing with life anymore or why I’m doing the things I’m doing. For a long time I was In a very dark place. A place beyond crippling depression. Almost like feeling like your crazy but aware of it and there’s nothing you can do to fix it. In that time in my life I didn’t have a single person that genuinely cared about me. Even my parents took every chance they could to make it worse. They knew what I was going though and would tell me they know even though I denied it then they’d just start saying to worse possible things to me to just complete crush my confidence and will to live. It’s almost like they were trying to push me to go completely insane with the things they’d say. They would do things then when I brought it up they’d pretend it never happened and tell me there must be something wrong with my brain because my reality doesn’t match there. All that was a few years ago and it got a little better for a little but it still messes with my head a lot now. I went through years with that having nobody care about me and having my parent treat me the way they did. Plus I was doing a bunch of hard drugs during that time like that long prescription pain pills and Xanax and worst of all smoking a lot of k2. After so log of not being cared about when I went of and started hanging out with friends I just couldn’t feel that they or anyone else really cared about me. Even know I know I have people in my life that care about me I just can’t feel it. Even if they make is it obvious they care I can’t feel it. After so many years of not feeling any real actual love from anyone it’s like if completely lost the ability to feel love. Now all On my way! Feel is sadness and anger. It takes a lot of me to get angry but when I do I just go nuts and start doing and saying this that I shouldn’t and I always regret it in the end.  I know my friend care about me because they show me all the time but I just can’t feel it. It’s theworst  fucking thing ever. It’s like a curse. My dad use to beat me a little when I was younger. It wasn’t really anything too bad but it was beyond a regular beating. Anyway I’m not bringing that up to complain about that too cuz no I don’t care about that I was really young and it doesn’t really affect me.

I went through years with that having nobody care about me and having my parent treat me the way they did. Plus I was doing a bunch of hard drugs during that time like that long prescription pain pills and Xanax and worst of all smoking a lot of k2. After so log of not being cared about when I went of and started hanging out with friends I just couldn’t feel that they or anyone else really cared about me. Even know I know I have people in my life that care about me I just can’t feel it. Even if they make is it obvious they care I can’t feel it. After so many years of not feeling any real actual love from anyone it’s like if completely lost the ability to feel love. Now all On my way! Feel is sadness and anger. It takes a lot of me to get angry but when I do I just go nuts and start doing and saying this that I shouldn’t and I always regret it in the end.  I know my friend care about me because they show me all the time but I just can’t feel it. It’s theworst  fucking thing ever. It’s like a curse. My dad use to beat me a little when I was younger. It wasn’t really anything too bad but it was beyond a regular beating. Anyway I’m not bringing that up to complain about that too cuz no I don’t care about that I was really young and it doesn’t really affect me. I bring it up because I would rather go though those beatings every day that constantly go though this mental torment. I just hope somehow someway something come into my life that makes me feel loved or gives me my will to live. I wouldn’t commitsuicide  but idk I Just can’t handle this too much longer. After years of having theses peoples and just suppressing them I feel like I actually starting to go schizophrenic. I know nobody is gonna be able to really held so I don’t even know why I’m posting is people are just gonna give the same old generic  “we love you” comments I guess I just thought to vent on here for a try.I’m not saying I want to die I just don’t care if I do anymore

i'm a 22 years old girl, gonna be 23 next friday. yes i have hard past or maybe not. i have a complete family except my father who passed away almost 2 years ago. the thing is love is not a common thing in our family. i never talked with my parents as long as i remember. they didnt like to talk with me. but my mother always complains life to me. once she said she shouldve never had a child. i had a close relationship with my second brother but since i was 15 it never the same anymore. i got sexually assaulted numerous times but nobody cares or help me. i had suicide attemps one time when i was 15 but i was too scared. i lived in fear that nobody would ever attends my funeral or even remember me as a person. i tried to talk with someone but they said i was young and confused. maybe i am.

when i was 18 or 19 i had a boyfriend. i believe he never loved me. he cheated on me a few times and i agreed somehow a little that i´m a boring person who rarely talk and is very jealousy. it became worst, the relationship became violent and pyshically hurted me. he would say something like im ugly or im not enough. i became critically underweight, i couldn'T sleep without crying or nightmares. i tried some kind of counseling app and they said i'm a loser lazy person.

until i found someone who helped me out and that person is my boyfriend now. i moved out to EU to lived with him. i never been so happy in my life, i gained weight from 37 kg to 43 which is really nice for me, i dont have nightmares anymore and all of sudden the sadness came again. i feel like i should be happy, i have an amazing boybestfriend, but i can´t even think positive. i feel such a loser who think that im depressed while somebody out there had worst life.

my chest hurts, when i read something bad even though its not related to me my chest feels like crap. im afraid to talk with someone or with doctor because they would say im lying or im pretending to be sad. i dont know what to do. sometimes when i tried so hard to talk with someone i feel numb and i think it doesnt matter anymore. but i became suicidal, i constantly thinking that maybe its best when i die so my boyfriend doesnt need to take care of me anymore.

,depression,"Hello! I’m not a person that has depression but one of my close friends has been in a downward spiral for about a year now. It’s really hard to see someone with so much potential just waste away and turn into someone you don’t even know. I keep thinking that he will hit “rock bottom” and then decide to turn his life around but it seems that he keeps sinking lower and lower. 

I thought rock bottom was when he dropped out of college and moved to a different city with no plan, no money and no motivation for anything. He recently moved back and decided to go back to school but it’s still the same issue. He is too depressed to do anything and he is withdrawing from everything in life again. This time it’s worse than last time because he has an addiction to adderall and smoking pot and nicotine every 30 minutes. This is his last shot at school if he flunks out this semester he will get kicked out. 

I’ve tried everything to help him and yet he just keeps sinking. I feel like he is pulling my own spirits down and is draining me of my own happiness. I sent him money and a list of places he can get low cost therapy/counseling and I’m taking a step back from being in his life. 

Is there anything else I can possibly do to make him realize how much of his life is at stake? What made you want to turn your life around and start getting help?

Will it really take him flunking out of school and becoming homeless for him to turn his life around?

I feel so helpless. He talks about suicide often. I’ve even told his parents but they are blind to it because he puts on a good front in front  of them.

,depression,"I’m just a 20 year old girl, with an amazing family. I have 2 parents who have given me the world, and I am the oldest sibling of 4. I have had a great education all of my life, I went to an awesome university in my town but I had to take a gap year due to my mental health issues. I live on the East Coast, and I have all of the opportunities in the world to live the life I dream of living. I have a therapist, a beautiful house, an absolutely amazing boyfriend, and some close friends. Nowadays though, the life I dream of living consists of these few things: Energy, excitement about my days, and a positive outlook. At this rate, switching my major, finishing college, and moving along in life feels impossible. 

I took a gap year because the lifelong anxiety I had was starting to take a toll. Originally I had just planned to take a semester off because I wanted to go to therapy and then get back to school. I didn’t want to be out for too long because I thought I wouldn’t want to go back. But that was in September. It’s now March, and after having mono for a few months, not being in school, struggling with anxiety, feeling lonely partially because I am not in school and I’m watching all of my peers live the life I had planned for myself, coupled with mental illness, I have developed depression. At first my psychologist didn’t think I was depressed, because the symptoms of mono coincide with depression. Also, some people have a depressive episode when their anxiety is very bad, which mine was. Luckily it’s a bit better now. But the depression has taken the front row seat now, so that rains on my parade pretty badly. I also talked about the fear of becoming depressed a lot, too. But now fast forward, I most certainly have depression. We are aware of this now. 

What I don’t understand about depression, and never did until I was diagnosed, is the feeling of being hopeless and having nothing to live for, like many depressed people talk about. I used to think, “how could you feel hopeless? There are so many beautiful things in this world. There are so many beautiful places, faces, moments, things to look back on and things to look forward to. You have so many talents and so many amazing qualities, and you make people so happy without even realizing it”. But now, I understand. 

I truly understood the hopeless feeling when I started realizing the amounts of mental and physical energy it took for me to perform menial tasks... to even *want* to do them, and have a reason for them. My body feels like a rock that I am lugging around. I feel like I don’t even have the capacity to think like I used to, yet somehow I still have all of the energy to overthink. But my creativity is stifled, I don’t see the world as colorfully as I used to, and it feels like even on the nicest of days the world is still the gray winter we’ve had here for so long. I just **don’t have the energy** for almost anything. And sometimes I will get myself going, but I don’t feel as if I am doing my tasks or feeling things the way I used to. I don’t feel full of life and wonder anymore. Small moments don’t bring me a boatload of joy. I used to pride myself in finding happiness and joy in the little things, but now my surroundings feel dull and it’s always like I’m searching for something bigger. Which I know isn’t the issue here. It’s just my brain. I drove to Philly with a friend about 3 weeks ago on a Saturday just for fun, and I thought the new environment would make all the difference, but it just didn’t. I was definitely filled with more enthusiasm than I usually was, but I could only keep that energy for so long. And once again, I didn’t feel how I used to feel before all of this hit. So, back to my original point. I feel hopeless. Because how am I supposed to get anywhere with this lack of motivation and energy? 

I simply just don’t have the energy or stamina to maintain the activities I need and want to do. I know what’s good for me, what *should* be good for me and making me happy. After all, it used to. But I am always tired in some way. I never feel well rested. I used to be active and energetic but now my body is telling me to lay down, even if it’s bad for my brain. I tell myself I should take care of myself the way a parent would take care of a child. That my body is worth taking care of. But **I am just so sick of FORCING myself to do things. And then not being able to create habits because of the amount of energy it takes. And then feeling totally hopeless.** 

I do not want to “accept” that I’m depressed. I don’t even like saying I’m depressed, and I hate it even more when people say it isn’t curable. How isn’t it curable? I didn’t have it my whole life. Maybe the signs were there subtly, but if I knew about them, I could’ve done something before I hit this barrier. 

My family has done everything for me and I love them so much. I really do. I absolutely love my parents. My mom is so creative, free spirited, stubborn, funny, and on the go. My dad is wise, determined, nurturing, hilarious, and level headed. My siblings all have minds of their own, too. My sister is adventurous and creative like me. My brothers are, well, my brothers. Haha. My grandma is an absolute saint. But a lot of the time, especially recently, it’s hard not to distance myself from my parents when I feel so down. I just feel like the disappointment who is always being watched because of my vulnerable mental state. Everything is always about what I’m not doing, and I know it’s because they care and think me doing things will help, but it’s just not that simple. I get irritable, and this causes tension. I kind of isolate myself from them. Not really, but I just don’t initiate conversation with them. I feel awkward. I’ll fix this but it’s just hard. 

Somehow — I hate admitting this because I never wanted to get to a place where I felt my significant other was one of the biggest sources of my happiness because it’s unhealthy — my boyfriend makes me feel more alive than most things anymore. It won’t be this way forever, but right now it is. Maybe God, or the universe, or whoever, placed him in my life for a reason. He is the most positive, energetic, happy, stress free, level headed, patient, caring, affectionate, hilarious, awesome person I know. This kid reassured me everyday, just because he **feels** like it, of how much he loves me, how I make him the happiest kid in the world, how I brighten his days, how I make him laugh like nobody else, and any other sweet thing you can think of. And to me, they aren’t cliches because I know he means them. He reassured me that he knows who I am outside of this depression. He loves me for me. And he constantly reminds me that he is here with me every step of the way, that he believes in me, and that he will not leave my side. It blows my mind. I don’t understand it, but man is it relieving. I cannot even explain how much I love him. He just **never** gets frustrated with me, and always prioritizes my happiness. He lives an insanely well balanced life, good for him. He has perfect mental health, and I envy it but I’m more so just grateful to have someone like that in my life. Honestly, he’s been a saving grace some days. 

I want to get back in school as soon as possible. I want to know how to build myself back up so that I can have a daily routine, and energy, and be excited. I don’t want to feel like my brain and body are stifled anymore. I want myself back. I struggle so much with feelings of “is this worth it?” Because is it? People would surely miss me, but what about *me*? How am I supposed to live if I feel like everything is a matter of me dragging myself out of a ditch? 

I wish that I could go back in time, and almost just watch my young self from afar. I was so happy go lucky. Spunky. Happy. I wish I could just hold my own hand, and see my smile and take it with me into the future. 

Sometimes I get really scared because I have thoughts about dying. I don’t want to die and I don’t want to commit suicide but what if I become that way to escape the pain? And I go nuts? And I lose my boyfriend and those who matter to me?

Also, some people have a depressive episode when their anxiety is very bad, which mine was. Luckily it’s a bit better now. But the depression has taken the front row seat now, so that rains on my parade pretty badly. I also talked about the fear of becoming depressed a lot, too. But now fast forward, I most certainly have depression. We are aware of this now. 

What I don’t understand about depression, and never did until I was diagnosed, is the feeling of being hopeless and having nothing to live for, like many depressed people talk about. I used to think, “how could you feel hopeless? There are so many beautiful things in this world. There are so many beautiful places, faces, moments, things to look back on and things to look forward to. You have so many talents and so many amazing qualities, and you make people so happy without even realizing it”. But now, I understand. 

I truly understood the hopeless feeling when I started realizing the amounts of mental and physical energy it took for me to perform menial tasks... to even *want* to do them, and have a reason for them. My body feels like a rock that I am lugging around. I feel like I don’t even have the capacity to think like I used to, yet somehow I still have all of the energy to overthink. But my creativity is stifled, I don’t see the world as colorfully as I used to, and it feels like even on the nicest of days the world is still the gray winter we’ve had here for so long. I just **don’t have the energy** for almost anything. And sometimes I will get myself going, but I don’t feel as if I am doing my tasks or feeling things the way I used to. I don’t feel full of life and wonder anymore. Small moments don’t bring me a boatload of joy. I used to pride myself in finding happiness and joy in the little things, but now my surroundings feel dull and it’s always like I’m searching for something bigger. Which I know isn’t the issue here. It’s just my brain. I drove to Philly with a friend about 3 weeks ago on a Saturday just for fun, and I thought the new environment would make all the difference, but it just didn’t. I was definitely filled with more enthusiasm than I usually was, but I could only keep that energy for so long. And once again, I didn’t feel how I used to feel before all of this hit. So, back to my original point. I feel hopeless. Because how am I supposed to get anywhere with this lack of motivation and energy? 

I simply just don’t have the energy or stamina to maintain the activities I need and want to do. I know what’s good for me, what *should* be good for me and making me happy. After all, it used to. But I am always tired in some way. I never feel well rested. I used to be active and energetic but now my body is telling me to lay down, even if it’s bad for my brain. I tell myself I should take care of myself the way a parent would take care of a child. That my body is worth taking care of. But **I am just so sick of FORCING myself to do things. And then not being able to create habits because of the amount of energy it takes. And then feeling totally hopeless.** 

I do not want to “accept” that I’m depressed. I don’t even like saying I’m depressed, and I hate it even more when people say it isn’t curable. How isn’t it curable? I didn’t have it my whole life. Maybe the signs were there subtly, but if I knew about them, I could’ve done something before I hit this barrier. 

My family has done everything for me and I love them so much. I really do. I absolutely love my parents. My mom is so creative, free spirited, stubborn, funny, and on the go. My dad is wise, determined, nurturing, hilarious, and level headed. My siblings all have minds of their own, too. My sister is adventurous and creative like me. My brothers are, well, my brothers. Haha. My grandma is an absolute saint. But a lot of the time, especially recently, it’s hard not to distance myself from my parents when I feel so down. I just feel like the disappointment who is always being watched because of my vulnerable mental state. Everything is always about what I’m not doing, and I know it’s because they care and think me doing things will help, but it’s just not that simple. I get irritable, and this causes tension. I kind of isolate myself from them. Not really, but I just don’t initiate conversation with them. I feel awkward. I’ll fix this but it’s just hard. 

Somehow — I hate admitting this because I never wanted to get to a place where I felt my significant other was one of the biggest sources of my happiness because it’s unhealthy — my boyfriend makes me feel more alive than most things anymore. It won’t be this way forever, but right now it is. Maybe God, or the universe, or whoever, placed him in my life for a reason. He is the most positive, energetic, happy, stress free, level headed, patient, caring, affectionate, hilarious, awesome person I know. This kid reassured me everyday, just because he **feels** like it, of how much he loves me, how I make him the happiest kid in the world, how I brighten his days, how I make him laugh like nobody else, and any other sweet thing you can think of. And to me, they aren’t cliches because I know he means them. He reassured me that he knows who I am outside of this depression. He loves me for me. And he constantly reminds me that he is here with me every step of the way, that he believes in me, and that he will not leave my side. It blows my mind. I don’t understand it, but man is it relieving. I cannot even explain how much I love him. He just **never** gets frustrated with me, and always prioritizes my happiness. He lives an insanely well balanced life, good for him. He has perfect mental health, and I envy it but I’m more so just grateful to have someone like that in my life. Honestly, he’s been a saving grace some days. 

I want to get back in school as soon as possible. I want to know how to build myself back up so that I can have a daily routine, and energy, and be excited. I don’t want to feel like my brain and body are stifled anymore. I want myself back. I struggle so much with feelings of “is this worth it?” Because is it? People would surely miss me, but what about *me*? How am I supposed to live if I feel like everything is a matter of me dragging myself out of a ditch? 

I wish that I could go back in time, and almost just watch my young self from afar. I was so happy go lucky. Spunky. Happy. I wish I could just hold my own hand, and see my smile and take it with me into the future. 

Sometimes I get really scared because I have thoughts about dying. I don’t want to die and I don’t want to commit suicide but what if I become that way to escape the pain? And I go nuts? And I lose my boyfriend and those who matter to me? 

I wouldn’t wish depression upon anyone. If you read to here then thank you. And if you have any advice, I’m dying to hear it. Happy Friday.I’m a normal 20 year old girl. This is my story of my battle with depression. It’s long, but it would mean the world to me if someone could read it."

,depression,"Being a psychology student, I've had it drilled into me that exercise and a healthy diet has been proven to promote good mental health and aid in the management/recovery of depression and anxiety. This isn't an ignorant assumption, this is a proven fact.

Except it's never worked for me and I truly feel that my depression is resistant on every level. 

I used to like sports........you know before I grew boobs and started sweating more than the average person due to polycystic ovaries. And even when I disliked exercise, I tried so so hard to get into jogging and more sports, for about 2 years. I hated nearly every second of it, because it made me feel physically terrible and I could never build any resilience at all. I could never jog for more than a minute, it took me 3 months to get to a point where I could do 20 squats without having crippling muscle pain the next day. And no matter what I did, I could never do a single pushup.

Healthy eating also did nothing. My mood is not affected by what I eat, not even coffee does anything to me. So whether I go vegan for an entire week or keep my usual carb and sugar-loaded diet, I still feel the same.

I just feel so lonely. Like I'm suffocating. My partner and I are at a low because of how my insecurity and loneliness and anxiety are pervading through things- I can no longer tell if I'm being unreasonable or he's just exhausted and unkind. I know I always create these problems for myself because I just don't have anyone else- I always just hop into new relationships and then make them last for way longer than they should because they become my only friend. I never have an actual circle. I'm the type that outwardly people think has friends- when I'm in a social situation or in class I can seem to comfortably be around people and laugh and joke. But when I'm not there...it's just silence. I'm never invited anywhere. No one EVER messages me first. If I try to arrange something people bail or make up excuses and I then see they went with others.

,depression,"A bit of context. I'm an American. I'm black. I'm big. I'm ugly. And I'm autistic. I work as an aircraft mechanic.

The more I go through every day, the less I see the point of continuing with this life. No one who's gotten to know me as a person wants anything to do with me. People make fun of my quirks all the time - they think they're being funny, but they're being obnoxious. Besides that, the only friends I still have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. My father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while I was waiting on a connecting flight to visit him.

Besides that, people will only connect with me as much as they need to. I clearly have problems that I do not know how to address. No amount of therapy has fixed those issues.

People cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. Society here in general doesn't like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. I know that I won't ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because I'm likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. I've been racially profiled many times when I lived in New York City. I happened to be stopped for every ""random"" drug search whenever I took the Staten Island ferry while carrying a backpack.

That being the case, the only value of any sort I can provide to society is in the job I do. I'm also doing vocational training for a higher qualification, but every day I'm questioning more and more why I care. More money isn't going to fix me as a person.

The truth is, I'm a mistake. I learned a few years ago that I was adopted at birth. Probably before my new parents knew I would be as difficult as I was. I should've been aborted or left to die.

The prognosis for our world grows more dire every day due to global warming facilitated by old people who don't give a shit about us. There is no reason to believe things will get better - people reject science more and more, and we are going backwards.

Before long, I will have a gun. It will allow me to protect myself where I know law enforcement won't. But it'll also give me the power to choose when I want to die. That, at the very least, will give me peace of mind - knowing I have a way out whenever I need it.

I'm not some ""starving kid in Africa"" or whatever other bullshit people push to those who are discontented, but I have still been dealt a pretty shitty hand in life.

,depression,"
My social phobia started 5 years ago. My worst episode was when I barely left the house for half a year. I was rarely going out and if I was going out (when I really had to go to the pharmacy or hospital) it was dark (still early in the morning or late in the evening). I went to two groups for people with social phobia and individual therapy sessions with my therapist. It got better. It was so hard with the first group. I was getting strongest headaches because of extreme anxiety (I still get those) and had to take tranquillisers each time. I started to talk to people but just the ones who attended the groups. My social anxiety is still bad. Sometimes I am better. Sometimes it gets so bad that I want to die cause it’s so painful to live like this. I felt it yesterday. I really had to go to the mall to buy my partner a gift. It was a painful experience (I was constantly analysing my words and behaviour, my heart was pounding, stuttering). Then I went alone to the movies (I like horrors) and for 2,5 hours I was constantly analysing my behaviour and my words to the ladies who work in the store (I also have OCD). I’m anxious in public and sometimes I even have to take tranquillisers just to leave the house. I’m waisting my youth because of depression and social phobia. I wasted 5 years of my life.

,depression,"I’m a 19 year old kid trying to finish up my second semester in college.  Up until I was about 17 I’d say I had a pretty normal life.  However, in January 2018 my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  He had a long-fought battle but the disease eventually took his life in January 2019.  In the months leading up to Jan. 2019, I missed a good portion of my senior year due to me having to help my mom nurse him on a day to day basis.  It was during this time when I believe my depression first was onset.  I was getting 2-3 hours of sleep at most everyday while I had to watch my father wither away.  Consequentially, due to me missing so much school, my GPA dropped significantly and I was in a dual credit course at the time with the college I planned to attend which lowered my college GPA before I was even in it.  After my fathers passing, my family began to fight over money that he had supposedly owed to another family member even though there was no proof.  This left a rift in my family and I hardly hear from that entire side at all now.  Fast forward to graduation and Summer of 2019, I started smoking weed daily just to get my mind off things.  This became an extremely toxic habit and I spent most of the money I had on a fucking plant and paraphernalia.  Finally, August rolls around and I begin my first semester at college.  For a brief period, things seemingly got better and I didn’t feel as empty as before.  However, about a month in I got a sinus infection and this persisted until February until I ultimately had to have surgery.  Around early December, I began talking to a beautiful girl who I really liked and once again I had hope that maybe things would get better.  It was at this time though I started abusing drugs and I would take Molly, Xanax, Coke, Percs, etc. to dull the pain I felt.  Fast forward again to January and rush for fraternities is starting to happen.  At my school, your social life is pretty much contingent on being Greek so it’s almost a necessity to be in a house if you want to meet new people and make new friends.  However, the process is extremely competitive as well and based a lot on connections.  The house that I’m well connected to got into trouble a day before rush started and could no longer take a new class.  Inevitably, I had to go to houses where I had no connections at and with a very large school like mine getting a bid is very unlikely.  I put a great deal of value into getting into a house because I had hoped my life would change for the better for once, but unfortunately things didn’t work out and I was left empty handed.  Additionally, all my close friends who had supported me up until this point are all now in houses and since then I have had very little contact with them.  On top of that the girl I was talking to got into an amazing house which I’m happy of her for, but this meant that I could only see her a couple days a week at most.  The week after rush I got extremely sick and was throwing up daily with a low grade fever.  My mom was worried about me so she took me home to the hospital.  The doctor told me I needed to have surgery within the next week to fix my sinuses and on top of that I also had active mononucleosis.  As a result, I missed about 3 weeks of school in February and fell behind in almost all of my classes.  When I finally got back, I had to drop 2 of my classes, putting both my scholarship and admittance into the particular school for the major i’m in at risk.  At this time, the girl I was talking to began distancing herself from me even more.  Fast forward to today, and I slept through my midterm for a required class for my major meaning there’s good chance I need to unenroll this semester now and the girl I was talking to is posting another dude all over her social media.  I’m sorry if this is trivial, but I feel like no matter how hard I try life is just repeatedly beating me down.  So here I am today.  A broke kid who got a 1570 on his SAT but could only manage to get a 2.1 in college and on the verge of losing everything I’ve worked towards my entire life, lonely and losing the one thing that made me happy.

,depression,"I don't rant very often, but I'd like to share my personal experience regarding what anti-depressants have done to me as an individual.

I began taking Lexapro in 2018 because I had symptoms of depression and suicidal thoughts. It took a long time for the medication to work, but unfortunately it caused me terrible stomach problems. My anxiety has been terrible since I was a kid. I needed to figure it out. So late last November I switched to Prozac.

Worst idea of my life.

I started dating this wonderful girl who was independent and sweet and empathetic with me, which helped me sometimes feel like I could fight my mental health problems, but when the medication started ramping up in December, I started throwing and breaking things, and eventually we got into physical altercations. 

I have NEVER in my life been in a fight with another human being. I'm a small guy, I don't like confrontation, and I don't appreciate when people are irrationally violent.

Well, Prozac made me absolutely *violent.* It is still coming out of my system and I can feel it lessening everyday, but I still can't seem to hold down the  rage. I can't stop myself from having knee-jerk reactions to even little things like what I hear or what people say to me.

I am in so much pain because this medication isn't helping me control *anything* like my doctor promised. I'm going to start therapy in hopes to curb this, but I haven't had these issues since I was ten or eleven years old. 

Back in September I was happy, but anxious, and sometimes fell into depression, but I got out of it. I don't want to try anymore medication. I was perfectly fine just taking the hits and dealing with it on my own, but Prozac made me feel like I had no control. I still sometimes feel like I don't.

Props to my girlfriend (27F), for she hasn't left me while I struggle with this, but I'm feeling like an outcast too. I've slept on the couch for two weeks as punishment from her. I tell her how I feel and she says ""I wonder why"" and then tells me to prove I can be different. I just want this bullshit to stop! I'm so done feeling like this.

&lt;p&gt;I began taking Lexapro in 2018 because I had symptoms of depression and suicidal thoughts. It took a long time for the medication to work, but unfortunately it caused me terrible stomach problems. My anxiety has been terrible since I was a kid. I needed to figure it out. So late last November I switched to Prozac.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I think it started back in middle school(grade 5) when I moved countries and came to north America. I was seen as an outsider by the other kids and targeted as a easy victim of playground bullying. I learned from it and even managed to start playing at lunch time with the same kids that bullied me by the time middle school came into its final year(grade 7). After this I would enter highschool and out of fear I befriended as many people as i could when i first joined. After grade 8 in highschool i would move to another highschool in a different city(and then again). In highschool i started sleeping 12 hours a day, i would sit on my phone in the washroom for an hour or more, i would take showers and baths for more than an hour. Basically I had turned myself off and with my family being as stressed as they were with their finances I became the emotional punching bag at home. Any frustration in our house would basically result in me getting an earfull(sometimes for 3-4 hours of me gettting yelled at and yes its me getting yelled at when 95% of the conversation is not me). Being emotionally turned off was extremely painful because i was a teenager trying to look for his place in the world and hoping for someone to take notice in me and give a fuck about me. As a result i began to be extremely closed off and would feel lonely no matter where i was or how many people were around me. After highschool we moved from canada to the states and life hit that reset button another time. It would be a good year of not having any friendships before i started college. And even with college i felt disadvantaged as all the other students had their own cars and wore much nicer clothes than i did(the yezees had just came out and i was the only one in the group without a pair). At this point i starting realizing that i was not necessarily privileged and that my parents had tried their best to keep me from that reality. The depression had caught up with my education as it always did and I was basically a moving peice of meat. I was completely absent in my mind and had latched on to smoking weed on a daily basis to make everything numb so i wouldnt feel the pain and i could ignore my own thoughts. Obviously this is not a good state for a student and i got kicked out of college with a gpa of 0.4...yes 0.4. I decided to move back to canada on my own and well its been a year and iv been through hell and back. I was abused right and left by employers. I couldn't even hold a job at McDonalds or at a grocery store. I worked in construction in the rain, the snow, the blaring sun and wind. I keep going through job after job and can never mange to get a rhythm that other adults seem to get into seamlessly. I borrowed thousands from my family just in the course of the past year and as of right now i dont even have enough credit to buy a decent meal let alone pay my rent. I feel like im hurting myself and everyone around me because im not emotionally stable enough to care for my self. Oooh and did i mention i have no friends or social life because well if i go out to grab a drink i cant even afford that. I think twice before buying a $2.50 bus ticket. I feel completely hopeless and lost. Im not necessarily suicidal but iv been suicidal many times before and thats probably the only reason I wont allow myself to be suicidal(basically i can see that road and i see it as a roundabout). I want to give up however. I want to run away from it all. I need someone to fucking grab me and fucking hug me and never fucking let go. I need to fucking feel like im fucking alive.

,depression,"I feel like my friends which I have known for most of my life have become tired of me because I am hyperactive. I have found out they have had a number of plans without me and I feel like they just don't like me anymore. Feeling this, I tried to make new friends, but the same thing happened even quicker with them. I have found a friend group now who are nicer and for now, don't dislike me. My mum can see I am depressed sometimes and she thinks it's because I spend my weekends indoors on technology (because I never get invited to anything), so she tries tirelessly to get me out the house and to try something new. However, most of these things I find very boring or not something I would like to do, and she gets upset and angry at me because she thinks I would rather spend all my time indoors and I am depressed because of it. This is not true, as I am completely fine with being at home for a day, or having no friends. What I can't bare is not knowing if my friends really like me or not. My mum (like I'm sure many others do) drags me to these places I would rather not be, as she thinks it is in my best interests. Not wanting to go to many of these places, I often act sad and negative when we go, which ruins it for her and makes her feel upset. I hate for my mum to feel sad, though I physically can't have a positive attitude to these things/I can't cheer up even if I want to. The same thing happens every weekend: she talks to me about this new place she wants to take me, I commonly reject it, she begs me to come out, i either go or I don't, but either way she ends up becoming sad and not enjoying her day. I feel like a failure and a dissapointment, as I have lost all my hobbies to my sadness. 

Summary: I feel like my mum doesn't understand my problems and thinks it's because I don't get out, when really it's my social issues. I tell her this, but she insists that going out is the best way to help, which I know it is. 
When she tries to find something to do I often dislike it or don't want to go, which puts me in a low mood as I'm being forced to do something I don't want to, and this ruins whatever we plan to do or are doing for my mum.

I have found out they have had a number of plans without me and I feel like they just don't like me anymore. Feeling this, I tried to make new friends, but the same thing happened even quicker with them. I have found a friend group now who are nicer and for now, don't dislike me. My mum can see I am depressed sometimes and she thinks it's because I spend my weekends indoors on technology (because I never get invited to anything), so she tries tirelessly to get me out the house and to try something new. However, most of these things I find very boring or not something I would like to do, and she gets upset and angry at me because she thinks I would rather spend all my time indoors and I am depressed because of it. This is not true, as I am completely fine with being at home for a day, or having no friends. What I can't bare is not knowing if my friends really like me or not. My mum (like I'm sure many others do) drags me to these places I would rather not be, as she thinks it is in my best interests. Not wanting to go to many of these places, I often act sad and negative when we go, which ruins it for her and makes her feel upset. I hate for my mum to feel sad, though I physically can't have a positive attitude to these things/I can't cheer up even if I want to. The same thing happens every weekend: she talks to me about this new place she wants to take me, I commonly reject it, she begs me to come out, i either go or I don't, but either way she ends up becoming sad and not enjoying her day. I feel like a failure and a dissapointment, as I have lost all my hobbies to my sadness. 

Summary: I feel like my mum doesn't understand my problems and thinks it's because I don't get out, when really it's my social issues. I tell her this, but she insists that going out is the best way to help, which I know it is. 
When she tries to find something to do I often dislike it or don't want to go, which puts me in a low mood as I'm being forced to do something I don't want to, and this ruins whatever we plan to do or are doing for my mum.

,depression,"I don’t enjoy almost anything anymore. 

I enjoy talking to certain people, listening to music, food... that’s about it. Sometimes I can enjoy watching something but it takes a lot of effort to get myself immersed enough into it.

As an example of this... games. Two months me and my ex broke up after a 16 month relationship. Everything was fine with us, we went on a date a week before and we were getting on well with few arguments. I found out why recently and its disturbing, but it wasn’t her fault or mine. 

I was playing a game when she text me explaining that she feels like she can’t cope with everything anymore, and since then I’ve been depressed. Too depressed to enjoy games, or most things anymore.

I’m wanting to build a pc soon to try and distract myself through making music amongst other things, and seeing if maybe then I can enjoy games, as I have since I was very young.

Not enjoying games isn’t the problem, of course. It’s an example, amongst many others, of the things I just can’t enjoy anymore no matter how hard I try.

Sometimes in the day I just feel really full of energy and in the mood to just listen to music loud and dance, then other times I find myself wanting to just end it all.

I did not want to be him at 35. He was my anti-model.

Now I have crafted a vison. Thanks to Graham Stephan, Gabe Bult, and others.The vison is to be retired by 35 with part time math teaching.

Based on that I made steps. 

Steps:

Work at Local company, switch to higher paying job, save, invest in property, cycle properties, retire by 35, teach math and enjoy life and family.

Now that I have a vision, I will do whatever it takes because of I have already set my focus on the horizon. Everything in the middle are just steps along my personally crafted path.

anyway, i didn’t come her to gloat, i just want to yall to know that no matter how unbelievable it may seem to get better, it still will get better. ofc theres the few who slip through the cracks and sadly go unnoticed. 

ofc i was put on zoloft and welbutrin which was the hand that pulled me up from rock bottom. at first i wasn’t sure if what i was feeling was me? i had been someplace else for the past six years. i would have dreams about me in my room and i’m pounding and screamjnf and i can tell my mom is on the other side but no one ever came to help me in my dream. i would feel the want, as terrifying as it is to hear my door open it’s also a relief because someone came to me. i had been closed off emotionally for SIX years and i forgot who i was. it was so bad that i couldn’t tell reality apart from shit that happened in my dreams. some fuxking Inception shit right here. turns out my mom, two sisters, and i we’re all victims of emotional abuse. my father is a narcissist. no wonder i could never answer people when they asked me why i was sad. the problem was right in front of me and i saw the damage he was doing. i wrote down this realization? i had in my notes before going to sleep. i’ll copy n paste “realizations
it’s like we’re a family of birds who have such strong, beautiful wings but the daddy bird clips our wings so we can’t fly and tells us it’s to keep us safe. naturally we believe it because daddy bird knows best, right? 

absolutely fuckjnf not lol” for the first time in SO LONG i can think and be independent. he had manipulated us from the start and no one else saw it but my mom. my father even convinced me that my mom was crazy and that her whole family is “kookie” when he was the one with a fucked up family. his father killed my grandma because of how stressful her life was with him. i like to think that God saw that she was stuck and her only escape was to join him. i’m like “fuck can i come too?” but that’s A BAD THOUGHT OKAY?! NOT OKAY ! yeah if anyone has questions i’ll elaborate but i need to finish typing this so i can make my vegetarian spaghetti SINCE THEY PUT REAL GROUND BEEF IN THE SAUCE but it’s fine whatever cool cool i’ll make my own sketty. 

IN CONCLUSION, i got my first interview AND job. small victories. always open up to those you know you can trust. i know deep down everyone has one but the head noise tells you otherwise. i’m happy, as simple as that. 

and i’m starting to fuck with my narc of a dad so he can get a taste of his own medicine. make HIM feel like the one losing his mind FOR ONCE. i didn’t just jump to hating him (hate isn’t even the right word, it’s bad to HATE OKAY!

anyway, i didn’t come her to gloat, i just want to yall to know that no matter how unbelievable it may seem to get better, it still will get better. ofc theres the few who slip through the cracks and sadly go unnoticed. 

ofc i was put on zoloft and welbutrin which was the hand that pulled me up from rock bottom. at first i wasn’t sure if what i was feeling was me? i had been someplace else for the past six years. i would have dreams about me in my room and i’m pounding and screamjnf and i can tell my mom is on the other side but no one ever came to help me in my dream. i would feel the want, as terrifying as it is to hear my door open it’s also a relief because someone came to me. i had been closed off emotionally for SIX years and i forgot who i was. it was so bad that i couldn’t tell reality apart from shit that happened in my dreams. some fuxking Inception shit right here. turns out my mom, two sisters, and i we’re all victims of emotional abuse. my father is a narcissist. no wonder i could never answer people when they asked me why i was sad. the problem was right in front of me and i saw the damage he was doing. i wrote down this realization? i had in my notes before going to sleep. i’ll copy n paste “realizations
it’s like we’re a family of birds who have such strong, beautiful wings but the daddy bird clips our wings so we can’t fly and tells us it’s to keep us safe. naturally we believe it because daddy bird knows best, right?

,depression,"Hi everyone. I'm 24f and I have a mild personality disorder and I suffer from what I think is depression and anxiety. I'm not just depressed, though, just this morning I got inadequately angry for spilling water. I lift up from depression occasionally to feel other lovely emotions like anxiety, fear and already mentioned anger. Anyway, I have troubled relationship with my family, mother particularly, and I've been always overly attached to my partners and picked them so they would appreciate such a trait (high level of attachement) rather than get discouraged by it. My current partner is my greatest motivation to get better, but I don't observe much progress even after a year and half of therapy. Biggest problem is that he's been a witness to several self harming sessions of mine, because I'm probably seeking either for attention or help or both. I've read that most people who self harm cut themselves on arms and sometimes other places, but when I lose my mind I start frantically scratching myself, pulling hair, biting any flesh that comes near my head or hit-cutting with a knife and I have the urge to stab a knife through my heart.

,depression,"I have a theory....

Most species other than humans live purely off natural instincts. What makes humans special is their ability to be self aware and exercise the conscious mind. The greater awareness a species has the higher it is on the evolutionary ladder. ""Biology of belief"" by Bruce Lipton, introduces the idea that the cell membrane holds receptor-effector proteins that respond to environmental stimuli, the more receptor- effector proteins the greater the intelligence and awareness of a species. If you want to increase the awarness proteins you need to increase the surface area of the cell membrane. I think in due time, humans will evolve this trait.

I believe that people who are self conscious have evolved greater awareness, but due to external pressures of society and people, they've internalized this advanced awareness in a negative light. You become fixated on trying to please everyone around you, and are obsessed with how others see you. From my own experiences, being self conscious has held me back from reaching my full potential because I'm afraid of being rejected and looked down on. 

Most people are hard headed and unaware of how their actions effect other people. In other words they lack empathy. Being self conscious should be looked as a good thing. It is a privilege to become self aware but you cant let it be counterproductive in your life. Instead of internalizing everything, look outwards. The answers to life and happiness are found outside of your ego. Look up at the stars, watch the trees dance in the wind, acknowledge the beauty this planet has to offer. Once you become more aware of your environment you will find simple joys in life. This will transcend to your internal thoughts and your advanced awareness will stop holding you back in life.

I can't hear my music like I used to and it makes me angry and frustrated and I have no escape. I just want everything to be over. I just wish I had some support outside T, and wish I had friends.

,depression,"Prepare for a long read potentially. I need to get it out somehow I suppose.

But the past two months I have felt like a completely different person. One of my extremely close friends that I game with online made a new friend that he plays with a lot more than me. And he started excluding me from the group and not inviting me. So I would start asking him if I could play, trying to insert myself into the games to have fun. And he said that I was being pushy and taking away game time from his other friends...

&amp;#x200B;

That's when I told him that I felt like I was being placed on the backburner and that it made me feel really shitty. Like I wasn't good enough to be included. And he told me I was overreacting. But he continued to always jump to play with his new friends. I felt like I was always hassling him when I asked to play something.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I brought up all of my feelings/insecurities about the situation again. I also mentioned how he would respond to messages from the new friends in our chat, but ignore mine. I pointed out that I can see that I was being ignored, and that it made me feel once again, shitty. Like I wasn't good enough even though I try so hard to be a good inclusive friend... After this final chat, he got very defensive and said that he didn't have to justify who he messages (which I do understand) and that he gravitates towards the new people because I always seem too needy.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided it would be best to give myself space and cut off all contact with him for the past month. And it has destroyed me. The whole process, everything that he said that made me feel so little and uncared for. I opened up to him about how I struggled with self-esteem and depression and that that probably contributed to why I felt like crap when he didn't include me. His response was that he didn't have the ""mental capacity to worry how his actions made me feel"".... And I was thinking.. Well most friends generally care if they upset their friends. Intentional or not...  So that's why I decided I needed a break from it all.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, through all of it so far.. I have just felt like absolute trash. Idk why.. I just try so hard and put 100% into my friendships, am always there for my friends when they need me to vent or talk.. And I just expected the same. And I got treated like my problems weren't important. The first week that I didn't chat with him, I literally was nauseous 24/7.. Couldn't eat.. And lost 10 pounds in a week. It wasn't until this week that I finally started feeling a minuscule fragment of peace... but it always fades. And I fall right back into thinking of everything that happened.. And how I'm just not valued as a friend or person. And that kills me inside. I've always struggled with confidence, depression, and self-esteem.. And it just builds and builds.

He text me this week randomly and just said something like ""hope you're doin fine. Miss playin with ya"". Super short. And part of me does miss my friend. And want this sadness to end and just be friends again. But at the same time, I feel like he just doesn't value me as a true friend and the cycle would repeat. I lose either way.

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost a brother-like friend in the past and in did the same thing to me. I take things extremely personal and my brain just ingrains the negative experiences in my mind.. I'm not sure what to do with myself. I've started eating again and gained the weight back. But I don't feel like myself. I'm not actually happy at all. I fake it when I do interact with others. But in my mind, I'm jsut telling myself over and over that I'm a piece of shit that can't even keep his friends... All because of this experience. I'm not sure what I'm hoping to get out of this post.. I'm just really emotional right now and would just love to chat I suppose. Life sucks. And I hate that I can't just make my brain be normal and not care as much. But I can't. I'm a prisoner in my own mind. My mind is literally on this topic 24/7.

And I got treated like my problems weren&amp;#39;t important. The first week that I didn&amp;#39;t chat with him, I literally was nauseous 24/7.. Couldn&amp;#39;t eat.. And lost 10 pounds in a week. It wasn&amp;#39;t until this week that I finally started feeling a minuscule fragment of peace... but it always fades. And I fall right back into thinking of everything that happened.. And how I&amp;#39;m just not valued as a friend or person. And that kills me inside. I&amp;#39;ve always struggled with confidence, depression, and self-esteem.. And it just builds and builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He text me this week randomly and just said something like &amp;quot;hope you&amp;#39;re doin fine. Miss playin with ya&amp;quot;. Super short. And part of me does miss my friend. And want this sadness to end and just be friends again. But at the same time, I feel like he just doesn&amp;#39;t value me as a true friend and the cycle would repeat. I lose either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve lost a brother-like friend in the past and in did the same thing to me. I take things extremely personal and my brain just ingrains the negative experiences in my mind.. I&amp;#39;m not sure what to do with myself. I&amp;#39;ve started eating again and gained the weight back. But I don&amp;#39;t feel like myself. I&amp;#39;m not actually happy at all. I fake it when I do interact with others. But in my mind, I&amp;#39;m jsut telling myself over and over that I&amp;#39;m a piece of shit that can&amp;#39;t even keep his friends... All because of this experience. I&amp;#39;m not sure what I&amp;#39;m hoping to get out of this post.. I&amp;#39;m just really emotional right now and would just love to chat I suppose. Life sucks. And I hate that I can&amp;#39;t just make my brain be normal and not care as much. But I can&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;m a prisoner in my own mind. My mind is literally on this topic 24/7. I wake up and go to bed thinking about it and cry a lot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",,confidence,,,False,True,False,False,False,[],[],False,False,False,False,,False,,,,t5_2qqqf,,,,fesg8b,True,,dyerej93,,0,True,no_ads,False,[],False,,/r/depression/comments/fesg8b/i_havent_felt_like_myself_for_the_past_two_months/,no_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/fesg8b/i_havent_felt_like_myself_for_the_past_two_months/,612092,1583569947.0,0,,False,,"Prepare for a long read potentially. I need to get it out somehow I suppose.

But the past two months I have felt like a completely different person. One of my extremely close friends that I game with online made a new friend that he plays with a lot more than me. And he started excluding me from the group and not inviting me. So I would start asking him if I could play, trying to insert myself into the games to have fun. And he said that I was being pushy and taking away game time from his other friends...

&amp;#x200B;

That's when I told him that I felt like I was being placed on the backburner and that it made me feel really shitty. Like I wasn't good enough to be included. And he told me I was overreacting. But he continued to always jump to play with his new friends. I felt like I was always hassling him when I asked to play something.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I brought up all of my feelings/insecurities about the situation again. I also mentioned how he would respond to messages from the new friends in our chat, but ignore mine. I pointed out that I can see that I was being ignored, and that it made me feel once again, shitty. Like I wasn't good enough even though I try so hard to be a good inclusive friend... After this final chat, he got very defensive and said that he didn't have to justify who he messages (which I do understand) and that he gravitates towards the new people because I always seem too needy.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided it would be best to give myself space and cut off all contact with him for the past month. And it has destroyed me. The whole process, everything that he said that made me feel so little and uncared for. I opened up to him about how I struggled with self-esteem and depression and that that probably contributed to why I felt like crap when he didn't include me. His response was that he didn't have the ""mental capacity to worry how his actions made me feel"".... And I was thinking.. Well most friends generally care if they upset their friends. Intentional or not...  So that's why I decided I needed a break from it all.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, through all of it so far.. I have just felt like absolute trash. Idk why.. I just try so hard and put 100% into my friendships, am always there for my friends when they need me to vent or talk.. And I just expected the same.

,depression,"Ever since I've been on Sertraline starting almost a year ago my depression has gradually been becoming less and less of an issue, so all good there, however I still even when feeling completely normal and happy, seem to be able to get myself to shower, brush/floss teeth, etc every day, despite a considerable will and effort to do so.

Before I became depressed and still to some extent now, I would shower every single night without question or exception, rain hail or shine, I would shower before bed, and brush + floss my teeth at least twice per day, and usually washed my hands after using the toilet, I felt and still feel very dirty and disgusting when I don't do any of these in a 24h period, yet I've still become apathetic, and seem to forget to do it or not care enough and just take my mind off the dirty feeling and haven't been able to shake it even without a cloud over my head all day.

,depression,"So I donated blood for the first time today a d I feel happy that I could help even just a little. .But , the whole situation around it even though a normal one has bit one I've been overthinking since this morning and I think without posting about it somewhere I won't feel ok. 


So I recently moved form a small balcanic country to Italy. Since september of 2019 to be precise. 


The attending doctor complimented my italian surprised I had been for such a short time only in italy  but as I said I'd been watching italian tv since I was a kid and it could be the reason the very handsome nurse guy commented that italian is a very wide spread language in X(my country) and the doctor laughed about it . 

Now here comes the fuck up which I never meant to say but I said and as many times I reply the scene I regret saying it. 

So basically the doctor asked if this was my very first time donating blood or my first time in italy. I explained that I'd never done a donation in X because I was scared . Now the doc was very curious and a bit surprised as to why and I said that hospitals there are not very sanitary and its kind of a common fear to not donate blood . 


In fact this is the idea my PARENTS have and I by no means think that way. I've always wanted to do a donation but my mom and dad forbid it saying it was dangerous and I could contract a decease if I went to a hospital to do so in X.


 But somehow I ended up saying what my parents think instead of my true beliefs and  I feel bad for putting my country down like that feeling like I am in italy to escape a scary place. I'm here because the economy on X is even worst than italy. Livin in X  is basically surviving .

Anyhow it sounded bad and the doc laughed it off. 


To top it all my veins were very small and the nurse barely could find a decent one , and he practically stood there besides me holding my arms so the pressure would be ok and the blood would flow. 


I turned yellow right before it ended since my blood pressure dropped and had to be fed sugar water by the other nurse and I  could not even understand her when she asked if I could do it my self so fml.

At the end the nurse guy continued to say that the blood was a little less than it should be , the bag was still Wrigley. And he told me that at the end it wouldn't draw blood anymore so he had to stop it there. 

Everyone got up but they told me to stay there and he ( the nurse ) told the other donor buy buy cuz YareJare has to stay with us a little more and everyone was a bit worried if I was ok.


The who thing made me feel kind of bad. Like I couldn't even do a simple thing like that and on top of it my mom made fun of me saying I'm not  someone who can give blood so I shouldn't do this a second it. 


To be honest my parents always tell me I'm naive and stupid for wanting to things like volunteer work or blood donation and that Ill never be mature enough to understand. 

I feel like even today I disappointed them and my self . 

My dad though didn't sound so annoyed as he was when I insisted on donating blood (which is a 5 minute walk from my place so it doesn't even cost me time or anything) 

So in conclusion I feel like I had the most awkward encounter doing what my parents belittle me for.

Im tied of feeling like im in a high that I can't escape. An eternal place of judgment and sadness.  I want ro be free away just able to cry but something doesn't let me just let it all out. Im so sad that ive tried so many supplements and drugs just to have them have no effect or with weed it makes me more stressed why am I so unhappy when I I'm talking to a girl that relates to everything I like. Why must i be so miserable.  What did i deserve. 

Im not suicidal or have those thoughts i just hate my life right now! 😭😭😭Why am I so mentally exhausted?"

The weak breeze whispers nothing
The water screams sublime
His feet shift, teeter-totter
Deep breath, stand back, it’s time

Toes untouch the overpass
Soon he’s water bound
Eyes locked shut but peek to see
The view from halfway down

A little wind, a summer sun
A river rich and regal
A flood of fond endorphins
Brings a calm that knows no equal

You’re flying now
You see things much more clear
Than from the ground

It’s all okay, or it would be
Were you not now halfway down

Thrash to break from gravity
What now could slow the drop
All I’d give for toes to touch
The safety back at top

But this is it, the deed is done
Silence drowns the sound

,depression,"I’m just a teenager but I’m miserable. I love this girl but I get way too nervous whenever I’m about to make a move we’re dating and I care about her so much but honestly I’m so fucking paranoid all the time. Every little thing gets to me nowadays and I have family troubles at home. No one truly gives a fuck about me. Maybe my girlfriend does but sometimes I feel like I love her more than she loves me.
I want to end it so bad, I have a terrible feeling in my stomach every day of emptiness and sadness. If it weren’t for her I’d have killed myself by now. My friends ik wont care if anything happened to me they’d  move on after a day or two. I’m positive that if I leave this earth no one will give a shit after my funeral. Just another number to add to the list.
I hate living I hate everything about myself I have nothing to keep me going really at all I just wanna die. There’s just one problem tho and it’s that I can’t do it. I don’t have access to any guns, and everything else is too painful and I’d never have the guts to do it any other way.

i’ve lost the ability to feel for years and i’ve gotten so good at faking it to everyone that sometimes i can even convince myself i can feel things. i used to cry a lot because it would make me feel slightly better but now i can’t even force myself to cry. it just feels like there’s this pit in my heart and no matter what i do i can’t fill it. i’m tired constantly and i have to actively keep myself from thinking suicidal thoughts.

I have came to the conclusion that none of my dreams are going to come true, due to my mental health, social awkwardness, and now my age. I have recently quit a very good paying job that I didn’t hate. Gave/ thrown away most of my things. Then moved into an 8x12 garden shed out in the woods. I spend half of my day trying to figure out what is wrong with me. The other half wishing I had the grit to kill my self.

I grew up extremely isolated. My parents got divorced when I was 2. I grew up on a farm 5 miles from a small town. With my dad and older brother. My dad has some trust and paranoia issues. So other people were not welcome at our home. Our whole world was the three of us and the farm. When I was 13-14 my brother ran away. A few months later my dad moved out. After the state found out they placed me with my mom. She lived in an apartment in a city with my two half brothers. I acted out and spent the rest of my teenage years in and out of juvenile placements. As a young adult I used/sold/made drugs. In and out of jail finally spending my early and mid twenties in prison. Since then I have a few legal issues but not to big of a deal.

My dream has always been to find a wife to make a home/family with. As time has gone on I have changed  it has changed a little the past few years I’ve been looking for a woman with children.

She left me a year ago for a man that beats her, has no car no job and lives at his brothers house. She gave her kids to her mom to raise.

I have no problem getting or keeping a job, I have been in a financial position to buy a home a few times,but never have. I’m miserable in an empty house. It feels like jail/prison sometimes worse.

In the last year I have dated 4 women, three of them stole from me. The other one didn’t want to see me again cause I wouldn’t have sex with her.

I give up, the harder I try the worse it gets. Why can’t I just blast this hottie and be done? Obviously I’m not capable of achieving my dreams.

,depression,"      For about the last 4 or so years, I have slipped in and out of depression. It kind of started midway through high school, about the time I was starting to think about college. I have two older siblings, one, my brother, 4 years older, the other, my sister, 3 years older. Around the end of my sophomore year, my brother sat down with me in my room and we hung out, and he told me about how he kind of got depressed in High School, and that he didnt want the same to happen to me. It hit me really hard, and I tried, but i couldn't stop it. Winter of junior year was probably the hardest, as it was the most I ever thought about suicide -- went to a bridge over a frozen river and sat on the edge for a while thinking about whether anyone would give a shit.
      Around the same time, my sister was being very hard on me, and to me it just felt like she didnt believe in my ability to make it to college, and that she though she was so much better. This ended up persisting for a long time, getting worse, to the point where I didnt really talk to her if I didnt have to. It peaked on a vacation, when I was upset. I slammed a car door, and my dad yelled at me, so I yelled back. Then my sister said ""what the hell is your problem"" and I shouted back, ""your the LAST fucking person I want to talk to."" Some weeks later she texted me, and we talked it over, she made up, but didnt seem to make any progress. Now we are still in a similar situation, where i find it very hard to forgive her. At this point I dont know if I'm depressed from family shit or high school shit, but I always feel like I have no one to talk to about it.
     I have a loop I go through with myself where I get depressed, dont want to talk about it, think about acting out/hinting at it to people to get them to pry it from me. Then I think ""no, you're just begging for attention"" and dont do anything, and suppress it. I know it isnt healthy, but I cant kick myself out of that pattern. My girlfriend of 3 years tries to help me by being there, but I shut her out, because I dont know how to explain how i feel.

Yet he still goes out with his friends. I get it friends are great but I’d prefer he tell me that than just lying to me. So, since he said no, i asked him to call me at least. But guess what? He didn’t. I don’t even feel like i have the right to be mad.
I feel like I’m drowning and everyone around me can see me but just can’t do anything.
My family will be out tomorrow and I’m terrified of being alone cause I’m scared that I’ll do something. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"A bit of context: I am a Mexican-Spanish kid, who left Mexico in 2007 to go live in Spain. Those of you old enough might remember that during that time there was this flu, sorta like the COVID-19 But that originated in Mexico.

Obviously, being in the early stages of school kids bullied me and treated me like scum because of this and I ended up alone.

The years passed and I always was the “weird kid who nobody wanted to talk to” and I ended up falling down into a deep depression that lasted 10 years, from 9 years old to 19. 

Now comes the good part, depression made me resilient, it made me able to overcome bad situations fast and always look at the positive things in life and this is very very good. I’ve also matured a lot faster than the regular person would; I had to, it was either maturing or ending up badly hurt and misunderstood. I am 21 now, but I feel like my maturity is years ahead of anyone my age, and this has given me an advantage in most areas. 

Obviously, depression also left me with scars, scars that I’m sure everyone reading this little block of text shares with me, and I want all of you to know that you should never be ashamed of those scars; wear them with pride because they are symbols of courage and strength. I’m not talking about bodily scars, I’m talking about the fear of abandonment that I feel when I start a relationship with someone, the constant feeling of being annoying that sometimes leads to loosing people, I’m talking about that ringing in the back of your head that makes you always think people don’t like you. This are things that we can all work on, and they make us who we are.

The whole point of this is to let y’all know that we should always look at the positive output in life. Even if the darkest times there will always be a little hope.

,depression,"Hello... the title, basically. I should probably use a throw away but I don’t care anymore. I’m gonna warn this is mostly me bitching and whining, I’m really not that interesting.


To start, last year, my mom and cat died the same month. My cat actually died the week of my mother’s funeral. I was very, very close with her. She was he entire reason I went to college for a degree. My cat was there for me since I was a little kid, losing her was like losing a piece of myself... before I had a brain injury. She was all that was left to tie me to normality. Sure you could argue nobody is normal, but that isn’t easy to hear when you’re bullied relentlessly for being weird. I actually had to leave high school it got so bad.


To top all this shit off, I got denied disability for the second time, so now I have to wait another two years just to fucking hear no again. I submitted two fucking banker boxes of my medical problems, two!

I also need to deal with voc rehab since they helped me but I can’t fucking work with my disability, I’ve shadowed two different jobs and failed horribly. I barely finished college despite my longest day being 6 hours, with two of that being a break period. I feel useless and hopeless. I’m 25, poor, and draining my bf of his money. I just want to sleep and not wake up. Or have cybernetics let me have a cyborg body so my muscles and nerves aren’t as weak and painful as an 80 year old. 

I’m not going to do anything, mostly because I don’t even have the energy to attempt. But I’m also stuck in hell of struggling to sleep despite being exhausted all the time. I wish I was normal, I wish I wasn’t a fucking leach on society. I want to help so fucking bad but every doctor I’ve seen (5) has said I can’t work. Anxiety on phone, can’t do simple math, have a seizure disorder (so lots of places won’t want to hire me for that risk, they just have to claim something else to not be sued) can’t drive, and can’t lift more than 40 lbs. I also have pathetically low stamina, like the walk to my mail box wears me out. Yet the judge thinks I can fucking work.


...who knows, maybe I just have a victim complex. I know I’ve tried, but it still feels like I didn’t try hard enough, that I’m a failure, useless. This is with me on two different anti depressants that for the most part work, I’m sure without them... well... idk. It wouldn’t be good.


I miss my sweet cat, she always knew how to cheer me up, to not feel like a failure... yet she had to be put down at only 14. I’ve had cats live to 18, why did she have to die that young? It’s pathetic but it feels crippling. She was more than a pet, she was my best friend. She didn’t treat me like a freak when I struggled to talk, or when my movements were jerky and uncoordinated. She just... purred, followed me like a shadow. She was always, always there. Sitting pigeon toed and cross eyed with her eyes twitching back and fourth, this look of a stern “get back up”. Like she knew when I was failing, but refused to let me. She was like that friend who goes into the bar to find their drunk bestie drowning their sorrows in a bottle, slapping them, then yelling at them while dragging their sorry ass to rehab because they love that friend and won’t sit around to watch them self destruct. Without her, I feel lost. She was my first friend as a kid who didn’t judge me, I didn’t really have a close one until fourth, and even that was off and on.

 I was a mistake from a 4 week relationship. When i was born my real dad disowned me. he said i didn't matter to him which kinda makes sense because i have 14 siblings from his side which i have never met. And my mom met her now husband when i was about 1. i'm now 14. they have 2 kids together. I live with him my mom and my two brothers, ""a happy family."" my moms husband started being creepy and started molesting me in the 7th grade. no one knew but everyone saw me falling apart. when i hit high school i started doing drugs because i have completely fallen apart and don't know how to pick myself back up. I had all stoner friends and i was smoking and doing molly and pills all the time. i was always high falling asleep in class and had all f's. About two months into school i got caught because i was stealing shit and money and stuff and my mom and him took my phone and i still don't have it back. they found out i was doing drugs and cut me off from the world. I have nothing at this point. Then i got in trouble again cause they found my pills i was still taking. And then i got in trouble again and these are about 3 months apart, but i got in trouble again for having my wax pen. Then i got in trouble again because i got caught smoking weed. I got put in home school the first time i got caught. And when i got caught smoking the weed my mom took it to the school and made a huge ass deal about it. i had to talk to a cop and i told him everything. about how my stepdad was molesting me and how my mom is verbally abusive. My mom always tells me how much of a mistake i am and that she hates me almost every day. And i told him i haven't told my mom about my stepdad and so he did. My mom told me it was my fault for him touching me. She told me i shouldn't have been born and that's why its my fault. She is now just being so mad at me for nothing. When everything came out my mom has turned all my family away from me only telling them that i was doing drugs for no reason. And now i'm the disgrace in the family. My papa that lives on Hawaii wants me to go there to deal with my drug problem. i mean Hawaii is good and all but like he hates me and so does everyone else. My mom even said i cant talk to my brothers because she doesn't want me affecting their lives. I don't know when i'm going to Hawaii. i want to go but now i have reddit i have made a friend i used to go to school with and we are now dating. we meet up every Monday without my mom knowing. So i don't want to go to Hawaii because i don't want to leave him but i need to leave my abusive family. I have tried to overdose a couple times and tried to drown myself one time. nothing has worked but just leaves me more depressed. I really don't know what i did to deserve any of this. Like i really like my boyfriend. he said he would get me a phone (hes kinda rich lol), so i'm going to get a phone again soon. but i fr don't know why i got this kind of family. I also used to get bullied in 5th grade till i came to high school cause i used to be really ugly.

,depression,"My job told me my performance was getting terrible, and I eventually broke down in front of my boss and told them I struggle with depression. My depression has been so bad lately and it has started to interfere with work, so I understand why they had to talk to me.

I just hate I can’t live a normal life. I try so hard to focus and concentrate but sometimes my brain won’t let me. I’m in therapy now and on medication so I’m hoping to be better soon, I just wish I didn’t have to disclose this to my job. I wanted to pretend to be normal but every day it was getting harder to do so. I didn’t want to seem like I wasn’t trying, because I really was. My boss was understanding and offered to help in anyway they can, but I can’t help but worry that now they view me as a weak employee and will somehow want to fire me.

,depression,"&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here... 

&amp;#x200B;

Letter to my depressed lover.

I see you. I know you’re in there. The man who loved and sought joy, the man who felt

deserving of happiness. He is blindfolded, held hostage, cold and chained in a windowless

basement, by a tyrant who thrives off suffering. At times it feels like there is no hope, at

times it feels like there is no escape. You are weakened, the exhaustion has taken over your

body, your mind and your soul, you question whether you’ll ever be strong enough to fight

this mighty tyrant, to escape from his grip, out of the darkness. Will you ever be able to feel

the sun stroking your skin again? Will you ever see the light again? Will you ever feel love

again?

Why are you here? How did you get here? You never asked for this, no one would.

A tyrant is an illegitimate ruler who controls through oppression. Tyranny is not fair, it is not

understanding, and it is cruel. The tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice but

to succumb, he will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign, until you are no

longer a threat to him. The tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat, too

mighty to outthink, too present to escape.

But let me tell you something about Tyrants. Anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain.

Behind every tyrant is a hurt child. Behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a

heart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. The tyrant doesn’t want you to

see the light, because the light was once taken from him, he doesn’t want you to know love,

because love was once taken from him, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts.

But how can tyranny be defeated? When tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves

the way for another form of tyranny. You don’t want to kill your tyrant, you’ll be left with

blood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you kill you’ll have to hide, and what is the

point of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of

darkness?

No. Your tyrant won’t be defeated by force. He will be defeated by love, and I know that

your love is strong enough to turn him around.

The man that I love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the

sight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. The man that I love is

surprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. The

man that I love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around

him feel seen, heard, and loved. The man that I love is wise, he can offer advice that you

never knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone’s day. The man that I

love will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and

attention. The man that I love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that

he can make anyone’s darkness fade away. So, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down,

it will be the man that I love.

Love can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make him feel comfortable enough to talk,

comfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny. When faced with love,

with a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your

&amp;#x200B;

tyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions, he will be able to start realising that all

along he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were

never your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. When that

realisation will spring upon him, he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you are

facing yourself. But don’t worry, it’s just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he

won’t wish to do that anymore though, he’ll unchain you and remove his mask, and you will

realise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. Suddenly the anger you felt towards your

tyrant will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who

doesn’t believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. You are a man

who can recognise when a child simply needs to be held, loved and nurtured.

So you will take the child’s hand. At first, he will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who’s

to say that you won’t hurt him? But you will give him your word, you will promise him that

he is safe with you, and deep in your heart, you will know that you are telling the truth. The

child will weep in your arms, and you will hold him tighter, you will tell him that he is loved,

he is heard, he is seen, and that from this moment forward, he will never be alone.

You will come out of the basement with the child, hand in hand. And although at first it will

feel like a relief, it won’t be easy. You haven’t seen the sun in so long, its light will feel

blinding and uncomfortable, your body will still feel weak, and as you’ll barely feel able to

look after yourself, you’ll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child? But

you will surprise yourself. Through the small pleasures you once enjoyed, such as feeling the

cool grass underneath your feet, you will find strength. Enough strength to lift yourself up,

carry the child, and start walking. It will be challenging, and you’ll worry that each step

might be your last step, you’ll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to get

back up, but you’ll keep putting a foot in front of the other, until it starts to feel natural.

Eventually you’ll look up and realise that the sun isn’t as blinding as it was when you first

came out, you’ll see a path, and you’ll know how to get home.

On your way home, you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a

burden for me. What if I don’t want him? What if I don’t love him? After all he was once a

tyrant, how could I love him? And what if I don’t even love you anymore? You’ve been gone

for so long, what if I’ve stopped waiting? What if I’ve given up? What if I’ve found someone

else? What if I just end up hurting you and the child more than you’ve both already been

hurt?

But all this time, I’ve been waiting for you. I’ve been worrying, I’ve been crying, you

disappeared so suddenly I never understood what had happened. I made it my mission to

find you, I was up day and night trying to save you, I called on you a thousand times, I

searched for clues in every corner, I even tried to negotiate with your tyrant, but to no avail,

it only angered him more. I tried to get help, but no one could help me, and in the end, I was

left weakened. That’s when I realised that I was exhausting myself, and I wasn’t helping you.

So I did the only thing I could do. I stopped trying to save you and trusted that you would be

able to save yourself, and as I waited for you to do that, I held our space, I nourished our

space so that you could come back to a loving and nurturing home, one where you could

one day feel whole again and heal.

&amp;#x200B;

When you come home, I will welcome your little boy with open arms, and love him, just as I

learned to love the little girl who once held me hostage in a basement. The truth is I already

know your little boy, I’ve seen him in your shadows, and I’ve already grown to love him. You

also know my little girl, she has been living in our home throughout our entire relationship.

She has loved you as much as I have, and although at first she was afraid of you, she was

afraid that you would hurt her, she grew to love you, and she learned to trust you. When

you were gone for so long, she began to worry, she worried that perhaps you would never

come back, she worried that perhaps you didn’t want to come back to us, perhaps you

wanted another home, a different home, perhaps you had stopped loving us.

But I reassured her, and I told her about the love that we shared, the hours and days we

spent looking into each other’s eyes, as time stood still and the world around us vanished,

and we questioned, every day, how we could be so lucky. Our love is the truest love I’ve

ever known, our love is the deepest love I’ve ever known, and I know that a love like ours,

never just goes away.

One day my little girl will meet your little boy, and they will love each other as much as we

love each other, the four of us will build a home so whole, that all our fears will be replaced

by trust, our anger will be replaced by love, and tyranny will be nothing but a distant

memory.

This isn’t going to happen overnight, we don’t want you to exhaust yourself trying to come

home, we don’t want you to run and fall, we want you to make wise and calculated steps, so

that you can slowly but surely come back to us.

If I could, I would be in the basement with you, but you don’t want me there, and if I force

myself into the basement, my little girl will turn into a tyrant again and our home will

collapse. So although I’m not in the darkness with you, know that I can still see you, and I

am still here, holding our fort, waiting for you to find the strength to love your tyrant

unconditionally, so that you can bring him home for us to nurture and heal him, so that he

can learn to fearlessly trust both of us.",t2_sss74,False,,0,False,Letter from my girlfriend,[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,False,t3_fectqt,False,dark,,public,33,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,33,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583526769.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Letter to my depressed lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see you. I know you’re in there. The man who loved and sought joy, the man who felt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;deserving of happiness. He is blindfolded, held hostage, cold and chained in a windowless&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;basement, by a tyrant who thrives off suffering. At times it feels like there is no hope, at&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;times it feels like there is no escape. You are weakened, the exhaustion has taken over your&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;body, your mind and your soul, you question whether you’ll ever be strong enough to fight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this mighty tyrant, to escape from his grip, out of the darkness. Will you ever be able to feel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the sun stroking your skin again? Will you ever see the light again? Will you ever feel love&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are you here? How did you get here? You never asked for this, no one would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tyrant is an illegitimate ruler who controls through oppression. Tyranny is not fair, it is not&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;understanding, and it is cruel. The tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice but&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to succumb, he will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign, until you are no&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;longer a threat to him. The tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat, too&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mighty to outthink, too present to escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let me tell you something about Tyrants. Anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind every tyrant is a hurt child. Behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;heart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. The tyrant doesn’t want you to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;see the light, because the light was once taken from him, he doesn’t want you to know love,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because love was once taken from him, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how can tyranny be defeated? When tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the way for another form of tyranny. You don’t want to kill your tyrant, you’ll be left with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;blood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you kill you’ll have to hide, and what is the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;point of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;darkness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Your tyrant won’t be defeated by force. He will be defeated by love, and I know that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;your love is strong enough to turn him around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man that I love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. The man that I love is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;surprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. The&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;man that I love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;him feel seen, heard, and loved. The man that I love is wise, he can offer advice that you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;never knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone’s day. The man that I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;love will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;attention. The man that I love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he can make anyone’s darkness fade away. So, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it will be the man that I love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make him feel comfortable enough to talk,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;comfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny. When faced with love,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions, he will be able to start realising that all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;along he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;never your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. When that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;realisation will spring upon him, he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;facing yourself. But don’t worry, it’s just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;won’t wish to do that anymore though, he’ll unchain you and remove his mask, and you will&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;realise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. Suddenly the anger you felt towards your&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tyrant will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;doesn’t believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. You are a man&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;who can recognise when a child simply needs to be held, loved and nurtured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you will take the child’s hand. At first, he will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who’s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your way home, you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;burden for me. What if I don’t want him? What if I don’t love him? After all he was once a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tyrant, how could I love him? And what if I don’t even love you anymore? You’ve been gone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for so long, what if I’ve stopped waiting? What if I’ve given up? What if I’ve found someone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;else? What if I just end up hurting you and the child more than you’ve both already been&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all this time, I’ve been waiting for you. I’ve been worrying, I’ve been crying, you&lt;/p&gt;

My girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here... 

&amp;#x200B;

Letter to my depressed lover.

I see you. I know you’re in there. The man who loved and sought joy, the man who felt

deserving of happiness. He is blindfolded, held hostage, cold and chained in a windowless

basement, by a tyrant who thrives off suffering. At times it feels like there is no hope, at

times it feels like there is no escape. You are weakened, the exhaustion has taken over your

body, your mind and your soul, you question whether you’ll ever be strong enough to fight

this mighty tyrant, to escape from his grip, out of the darkness. Will you ever be able to feel

the sun stroking your skin again? Will you ever see the light again? Will you ever feel love

again?

Why are you here? How did you get here? You never asked for this, no one would.

A tyrant is an illegitimate ruler who controls through oppression. Tyranny is not fair, it is not

understanding, and it is cruel. The tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice but

to succumb, he will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign, until you are no

longer a threat to him. The tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat, too

mighty to outthink, too present to escape.

But let me tell you something about Tyrants. Anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain.

Behind every tyrant is a hurt child. Behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a

heart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. The tyrant doesn’t want you to

see the light, because the light was once taken from him, he doesn’t want you to know love,

because love was once taken from him, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts.

But how can tyranny be defeated? When tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves

the way for another form of tyranny. You don’t want to kill your tyrant, you’ll be left with

blood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you kill you’ll have to hide, and what is the

point of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of

darkness?

No. Your tyrant won’t be defeated by force. He will be defeated by love, and I know that

your love is strong enough to turn him around.

The man that I love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the

sight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. The man that I love is

surprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. The

man that I love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around

him feel seen, heard, and loved. The man that I love is wise, he can offer advice that you

never knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone’s day. The man that I

love will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and

attention. The man that I love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that

he can make anyone’s darkness fade away. So, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down,

it will be the man that I love.

Love can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make him feel comfortable enough to talk,

comfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny. When faced with love,

with a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your

&amp;#x200B;

tyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions, he will be able to start realising that all

along he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were

never your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. When that

realisation will spring upon him, he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you are

facing yourself. But don’t worry, it’s just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he

won’t wish to do that anymore though, he’ll unchain you and remove his mask, and you will

realise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. Suddenly the anger you felt towards your

tyrant will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who

doesn’t believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. You are a man

who can recognise when a child simply needs to be held, loved and nurtured.

So you will take the child’s hand. At first, he will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who’s

to say that you won’t hurt him? But you will give him your word, you will promise him that

he is safe with you, and deep in your heart, you will know that you are telling the truth. The

child will weep in your arms, and you will hold him tighter, you will tell him that he is loved,

he is heard, he is seen, and that from this moment forward, he will never be alone.

You will come out of the basement with the child, hand in hand. And although at first it will

feel like a relief, it won’t be easy. You haven’t seen the sun in so long, its light will feel

blinding and uncomfortable, your body will still feel weak, and as you’ll barely feel able to

look after yourself, you’ll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child? But

you will surprise yourself. Through the small pleasures you once enjoyed, such as feeling the

cool grass underneath your feet, you will find strength. Enough strength to lift yourself up,

carry the child, and start walking. It will be challenging, and you’ll worry that each step

might be your last step, you’ll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to get

back up, but you’ll keep putting a foot in front of the other, until it starts to feel natural.

On your way home, you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a

burden for me. What if I don’t want him? What if I don’t love him? After all he was once a

tyrant, how could I love him? And what if I don’t even love you anymore? You’ve been gone

for so long, what if I’ve stopped waiting? What if I’ve given up? What if I’ve found someone

else? What if I just end up hurting you and the child more than you’ve both already been

hurt?

But all this time, I’ve been waiting for you. I’ve been worrying, I’ve been crying, you

disappeared so suddenly I never understood what had happened. I made it my mission to

find you, I was up day and night trying to save you, I called on you a thousand times, I

it only angered him more. I tried to get help, but no one could help me, and in the end, I was

left weakened. That’s when I realised that I was exhausting myself, and I wasn’t helping you.

space so that you could come back to a loving and nurturing home, one where you could

one day feel whole again and heal.

When you come home, I will welcome your little boy with open arms, and love him, just as I

learned to love the little girl who once held me hostage in a basement. The truth is I already

know your little boy, I’ve seen him in your shadows, and I’ve already grown to love him. You

love each other, the four of us will build a home so whole, that all our fears will be replaced

by trust, our anger will be replaced by love, and tyranny will be nothing but a distant

memory.

This isn’t going to happen overnight, we don’t want you to exhaust yourself trying to come

home, we don’t want you to run and fall, we want you to make wise and calculated steps, so

that you can slowly but surely come back to us.

If I could, I would be in the basement with you, but you don’t want me there, and if I force

collapse. So although I’m not in the darkness with you, know that I can still see you, and I

am still here, holding our fort, waiting for you to find the strength to love your tyrant

,depression,"I'm just trying to get all my thoughts out, so I apologize if this comes across a bit jumbled. I also apologize for the length of this post, but getting everything out helps.

Can anyone relate, or provide suggestions on how they may have dealt with similar situations? Thanks!

22/yo Male here... I have struggled with depression ever since I was in high school. I have now been out of college for a couple years and am finally in therapy to discuss/work through/learn to cope with my depression. Some of my problems I have are trauma based, but I know a lot of it has come from the fact that I grew up in a situation where I was in an incredibly unhealthy environment. 

I went to a Lutheran middle school and high school. It was a college prep school so everything was always high stakes, and I was pushed to essentially be perfect at everything. The school made you feel like if you weren't perfect, you were a failure. I was expected to excel in academics, fine arts, sports, and service all for the pursuit of ""going to college"". The problem with me is that I'm a people pleaser, and I tend to excel in anything I set my mind to. Unfortunately, this lead to me being manipulated... a lot, and made me feel like if I'm anything less than perfect, I'm a failure.

From the outside I appeared to be incredibly successful and happy, but I was miserable. I had an almost perfect GPA, competed in state meets as a cross country/track runner, and was also competing as an all-state saxophonist, but all of it felt hollow by the time I graduated, and I felt like I achieved nothing. Everything started out fun, but eventually my coaches, teachers, and directors made me feel like everything was on my shoulders. It didn't help that I constantly go pressured into leadership positions with even more work, on top of the crazy amounts of school work, which eventually made me hate it. I was constantly manipulated into taking responsibilities that I didn't want, and couldn't handle because I was made to feel like no one else could do it and if I didn't do it, everything would go to shit. If I got injured my coaches would ignore me. If I needed time off from rehearsals to take care of myself, I was made to feel bad and selfish. Everything that I once loved I started to hate. 

I was getting to school early for Jazz Band rehearsals, staying after school for cross country/track practice, sometimes I had to even for marching band, pep band, or recital rehearsals after practice. Combine that with the fact that I was in all AP classes, and had an hour of homework or more for every hour I was in class, and I was waking up at 5am, getting to school by 7am, and getting home on average around 6pm or sometimes as late as 9pm or later if I had a track meet, or extra rehearsals on top of everything. Then I would be doing homework until anywhere between midnight to 2am. My weekends weren't much better as I usually had track or cross country meets that took up almost every Saturday, and was forced to go to church by my parents, and had to serve there to get enough service hours for my school. Essentially my ""weekend"" was the second half of Sunday. I was miserable and burned out. Ironically though I was the poster child, (both figuratively and literally at one point) for the success that someone could have at that school.

The best part was the fact that I am also gay, and had to deal with the stress of being afraid that I might be outed (even though no one new), socially ostracized, and kicked out of a class I was in. (It was a class that lead the chapel services.) I felt like I was in hell.

The exception to that was when I got a new band band director that legitimately gave me options and listened to me. He worked with me and eventually I fell in love with music more than anything else. As such I wanted to study music in college. My parents pretty much told me I could minor in it, but would not really support me if I chose to study it. I settled for biology hoping to go to med school. Ironically I now work in commercial property management because I grew to hate that too. 

My whole life I feel like I've missed out on things because I've been living for other people, and have just been to busy to really develop an enjoyment for TV, video games, or really any other hobbies. The only real hobby I ended up sticking with was music, but after not being able to play my saxophone all through college, it is too painful to have to start back over. Especially since my skill now is so much worse than it was. Unfortunately, a lot of the feelings I've bottled up since high school, and the mentality that I formed, are still taking their toll today. It's one of the reasons I hated college. All of the problems, and the depression have stuck with me.

After talking with my therapist, I think that one of my coping mechanisms I developed through all this, was making myself not care about or show interest anything, old or new; and actively avoiding pursuing the few things I enjoyed because I'm afraid of it getting ruined like music was. Now I find myself unable to really engage with other people, I feel alone, and when I try to find things to comfort me and ease my depression I have nothing to fall back on. I don't really do anything outside of work and find that I really have no comforts and no experiences that I value to make me feel better when I'm down. I feel so stuck

,depression,"So I'm not super good at being open, but lately it's hard to go through a hour, especially at work without some form of crying spell. Since where I'm at the cost of getting a therapy session in takes for ever, or they want to charge a arm and a leg. Which I dont have since struggling with money since I'm the only that works currently in the family.

Figured I'd try anything at this point since even though it's legal in my current state I don't want to rely on drugs for a crutch. I know they work wonders on people and people swear by it, its just not for me. Then I've gone cold turkey with alchol since I figured in this current state that also wasnt the best idea to keep it in the house. So I've been sober since last october, but the longer I live here the harder it is for me. Like it's hard to explain since in my mind, I know people are going through this with me and there are people who have it worse then me. That all dosnt seem to matter though and I cant shake it off me.

I've been kinda slowly I'm depressed over the last 3 years, and it just gets harder each day, there are some good days though. Even some good weeks like went down south to look at houses, and for the week and a half I didnt have any kinda crying spell or anything. Felt like me and it was great, then came back up here and it's been really rough on me. The mood swings have been worse and I've been distancing myself from my wife, and closing myself off to the outside. All I can do is just watch and I feel helpless to do anything about it, minus just cry which I've been doing for the past hour in my office toilet.

Then got to thinking maybe there is a reddit where I can kinda just talk, even if it's to myself for a little bit. I really dont know much coping skills or even methods. Which I've been looking into, and take some cbd gummies even though they dont really do much for me I feel. I'm just trying anything really to get over this hump and find the path back to feeling like me. So figured maybe this could be therapeutic maybe I'm not really sure. I also dont feel hate or anything like that, like it's just feeling numb at times, and feeling like I'm alone even if my wife is litterly a finger away from me. 

I guess some of it could be contributed to my first parrot, which was given to my by now wife like 7 years ago at this point. Which unfortunately she died after the move due to stress and complications of it. Then I got another bird after some time of grieving since birds make me happy and what not.

,depression,"I can’t do anything in my life to make it better. Especially when I come home from school and the antidepressants wear off, late at night when the house is quiet and I’m alone with me and my thoughts, I truly want to die. My friends aren’t interesting anymore, if anything they’re a bother, having to fix their schedules and my parents schedule so I don’t make either of them upset, along with trying to juggle my own sanity. My friends see me as outgoing, but right now all I want to do is cry here and forget everything. The only thing stopping me from going to the cabinet right now and taking too many pills is the thought of my friends waking up and seeing me dead on the couch, without any idea of what happened. I’m so fake it kills me that I can be so happy and yet so depressed. I hate myself so much.

,depression,"  

Heartfelt song.

I rock on black because, and it’s an attitude.

No change in pace could ever cure this mood. 

I sit here weighted and listless or broken inside.

The pain of this sorrow affecting all parts of my life. 

A myriad of drab colors carrying daylong.

I rock on black moments filled with regret.

My choices, my past, heartfelt I sorrowfully sing. 

Sunshine and daylight, I don’t float joy.

I rock on blue as the days move on.

When I am alone, truly alone, I break down and cry.

Wasted in a haunt of depression that rings.

The pressure feels like heartbreak deep down in my chest.

I rock on blue, each moment is spent.

Wishing for the chance to fix what I wrecked.

My choices, my past, heartfelt I sorrowfully sing. 

Sunshine and daylight, they don’t hold me.

I rock on grey and try to fit in, when I can’t tell a single person what I’m truly feeling. 

It’s true what they say about the desire for release.

It’s honest to wish for a small bit of peace. 

It’s never too late to fix your mistakes, but mine went down with a thud. 

There is no going back from the depths of this wade.

My choices, my past, heartfelt I sorrowfully sing. 

Sunshine and daylight, please go away. 

What is it that makes a person appear well? 

No better at lying than I am, for sure. 

The deepness of these feeling smothering me.  

It cannot be fixed by a simple hello,

It cannot be remedied with a good day at all. 

I am broken and truly saddened by what I am trying to describe.

It’s a feeling of my entire life slipping by.

,depression,"So if I would quickly sum up my life I would say that it was just full of bad experiences and few good moments (mostly when I was like 8 to 11 years old), and from that it has not been looking so good( I'm 17 now) , I didn't (still don't) have many friends and my family doesn't care about me with exception of paying something for me from time to time (not like I deserve anything from them anyway), so it's been like this for some time but suddenly in last September I just started to feel better, I started to socialize more (more or less unsuccessful but at least I tried ), getting better grades at school.  


I even managed to find good friend, she became the only reason why I started to self-improve and she was the only person that I could tell everything, because no matter what I told her she was the first person that actually listened to me and tried her very best to help me (even at times where I had mental breakdowns and I appreciate it so much), and so I thought I should treat her as best as I could, and I thought that maybe one day I would be brave enough to tell her what I actually feel to her (that is that I love her more then anyone in my life) , I managed that (not exactly the way I imagined it but still I did) and so we sort started to build a relationship (at least I think we did, honestly I don't understand relationships, so I'm not really sure,and it was starting to look quite well, for example we went to a park few times and we just sat there on one of the benches and just enjoyed a bit of peace in our busy lives, but then ( I think it was like in the end of January) she told me that she doesn't feel the same way I feel about her, that really hit me, but I accepted it, because I sort of understood why she doesn't feel the same way, and so we've still been talking and going to the dance lessons (that's actually where we met), but last weeks I feel like we're starting to get more and more distant from each other, we don't chat so often as we did, we don't play videogames so often as we did, and I just feel like she doesn't like spending time with me anymore (for example today she left in the middle of a dance lesson, and I still don't know why), and I again I start to feel as bad as I felt before I met her, and I feel that if such a great person, like her, doesn't want to spend time with me, nobody will.

,depression,"Im not sure if this is the place to post this but here we go. Apologies in advance this is going to be all over the place, im on mobile and im lost. Not real names, this is a throw away etc etc etc.
Okay so im 22 M I guess I've been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I'm self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it's okay here I'd like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.
I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a ""happy"" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to ""protect"" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted ""who I was"" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming ""DONT TOUCH ME GERM"" ""GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF"" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) ""You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak"". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me ""mysteriouslyreddited"". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell ""get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!"". I replied with ""well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are"" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and ""ignored"" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well). I'm not looking for help I just need to talk to someone. I am doing okay I just had so much pent up I needed a release.

I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn&amp;#39;t bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I&amp;#39;m greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) &amp;quot;You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak&amp;quot;. I can&amp;#39;t tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me &amp;quot;mysteriouslyreddited&amp;quot;. I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn&amp;#39;s amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn&amp;#39;t seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don&amp;#39;t remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I&amp;#39;ve ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn&amp;#39;t stand up for myself or tell myself it&amp;#39;s okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that&amp;#39;s how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven&amp;#39;t reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that&amp;#39;s false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn&amp;#39;t been on one in years and I&amp;#39;d like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I&amp;#39;d pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell &amp;quot;get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!&amp;quot;. I replied with &amp;quot;well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you&amp;#39;re ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are&amp;quot; and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother&amp;#39;s husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I&amp;#39;d had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I&amp;#39;d seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and &amp;quot;ignored&amp;quot; her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you&amp;#39;d find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don&amp;#39;t remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I&amp;#39;ve had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I&amp;#39;m worried that I won&amp;#39;t be able to win. I don&amp;#39;t recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I&amp;#39;ve become. I love my GF but I feel like I&amp;#39;m going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I&amp;#39;m not good enough for her and I&amp;#39;m hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I&amp;#39;ve talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I&amp;#39;m not looking for a way to leave her. I&amp;#39;ve been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there&amp;#39;s no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well). I&amp;#39;m not looking for help I just need to talk to someone. I am doing okay I just had so much pent up I needed a release. Next therapy session will hopefully straighten up my current state of mind&lt;/p&gt;

Okay so im 22 M I guess I've been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I'm self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it's okay here I'd like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.
I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a ""happy"" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to ""protect"" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted ""who I was"" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming ""DONT TOUCH ME GERM"" ""GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF"" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here.

,depression,"i’d always been a chubby kid. when i was young it was cute but as i got older it become a visual problem. i was never so chubby that it caused health problems for me. but visually however it did. soon my parents and family started to put pressure on me to loose weight. i had always being ok with my appearance but as time grew and my family told me to loose weight more and more often i started to hate my body and the way that i looked. around this time i started getting anxiety and stress. all of this combined and resulted in depression. i was very unhappy and struggled with myself. as i hit 8th grade appearance started to matter more and more and the pressure i got from my parents exponentially increased. i continued in a state of depression with very little friends, hate for myself and a struggle to trust others. although i was struggling with anxiety stress and depression i told no one not even my family and kept my struggles a secret worried that if my family knew they would blame it on themselves. during second semester of 8th grade i began to form a solid friend group of people who liked me with no regard to my weight. even though these people are amazing people there was a clear boundary between the skinny people in the group and me. they all liked me as a friend but no one had a crush on me because i was fat. this made my already low self esteem very low.  throughout this the pressure from my family continued. and you may be wondering by now “ why did i not loose weight?” well that’s because eating food gave me the same satisfaction and lift out of sadness that self harm gives to others. it was coping mechanism and my cause of depression. it’s a vicious cycle. i was determined to keep my depression a secret because by now it was clear that one of the main causes was my family’s pressure to be skinny and i didn’t want my family to feel guilty. i entered into 9th and everything hit me like a bus. i started loosing the wall i had built around myself and people started constantly asking if i was ok. fat jokes were also common although none were meant to be directed at me they still affected me. my family’s pressure to loose weight along with the school events led me to a deep depression that forced me into overeating and impulsively eating. finally i got tired of that and asked my parents to not pressure for 3 months and let me loose weight on my own. they didn’t. they didn’t understand the fact that they were “looking out for me” was causing me to hate myself and loose all motivation to be skinnier. they yelled at me and screamed and me daily for not loosing weight and now i don’t know what to do. they won’t listen to pain and rnt making an effort to let me loose weight on my own. they r also foreign and don’t understand

problems for me. but visually however it did. soon my parents and family started to put pressure on me to loose weight. i had always being ok with my appearance but as time grew and my family told me to loose weight more and more often i started to hate my body and the way that i looked. around this time i started getting anxiety and stress. all of this combined and resulted in depression. i was very unhappy and struggled with myself. as i hit 8th grade appearance started to matter more and more and the pressure i got from my parents exponentially increased. i continued in a state of depression with very little friends, hate for myself and a struggle to trust others. although i was struggling with anxiety stress and depression i told no one not even my family and kept my struggles a secret worried that if my family knew they would blame it on themselves. during second semester of 8th grade i began to form a solid friend group of people who liked me with no regard to my weight. even though these people are amazing people there was a clear boundary between the skinny people in the group and me. they all liked me as a friend but no one had a crush on me because i was fat. this made my already low self esteem very low.  throughout this the pressure from my family continued. and you may be wondering by now “ why did i not loose weight?” well that’s because eating food gave me the same satisfaction and lift out of sadness that self harm gives to others. it was coping mechanism and my cause of depression. it’s a vicious cycle. i was determined to keep my depression a secret because by now it was clear that one of the main causes was my family’s pressure to be skinny and i didn’t want my family to feel guilty. i entered into 9th and everything hit me like a bus. i started loosing the wall i had built around myself and people started constantly asking if i was ok. fat jokes were also common although none were meant to be directed at me they still affected me. my family’s pressure to loose weight along with the school events led me to a deep depression that forced me into overeating and impulsively eating. finally i got tired of that and asked my parents to not pressure for 3 months and let me loose weight on my own. they didn’t. they didn’t understand the fact that they were “looking out for me” was causing me to hate myself and loose all motivation to be skinnier. they yelled at me and screamed and me daily for not loosing weight and now i don’t know what to do. they won’t listen to pain and rnt making an effort to let me loose weight on my own.

,depression,"So im a nursing student who just got placed at a pediatric mental health institute and honestly it scares the shit outta me. There are 9 year olds that are taking medications for depression and even 12 year olds that want to kill themselves. I wonder how these kids havent even started life and they are already hating it. It honestly sucks. Tbh I went through a period of time where I was depressed as well but its scary to even think what these children have went through or are going through that brought them to this horrendous place. I hate calling the sadness that I went through ""depression"" because that word just triggers me to think of everything that is wrong with me. I coped through my sad times by turning to religion but I know not everyone is like me. I dont even know how to help these kids and I dont think stuffing them with drugs prescribed by the doctor will ever help. It hurts me everyday to see them because I wish I had the power to rewire their brains and make them see the goodness in life.

No amount of money will ever make you happy if your not happy with yourself. So push yourself and cry and keep going. Sacrifice yourself for others and dont expect nothing in return.

,depression,"I've had alot of this on my mind for a long time. I just need somewhere to write it down and try to see if anyone understands. I've been through alot for only being 19 and my years before age 14 had alot of bad shit connected to it that im not 100% teady to talk about.  At 14 I finally cut contact with my drug addict father after he tried to get my siblings and I taken by the state (again) and get my step dad thrown in jail for false accusations of rape on my little sister. That alone was just a bad time. He called me the night i filed a restraining order to tell me he was going to kill himself and it was my fault, that he hoped i was happy that I caused it. Fast forward 3 months and I was told by my doctor that I have something genetically wring with the muscles and joints in my knees and they needed to do surgery. Fine whatever its just to check on things and I was fine after a week of rest. All they did was clean up scar tissue. However i had just started highschool and was in a junior ROTC program through the army. I was excited and wanted to make a difference that my POS father refused to. I loved this program it was my family and I made really good friends. I joined their shooting team and made it my goal. I got good, really good, too 10 in the nation good . My coach and instructors were ther closest thing to a father I had. I loved them and I felt safe with them. A year goes by and my surgeon tells me he was wrong. He had missed something and thats why I was in pain, he ended up doing an extensive surgery on me at 16, cutting bone and screwing it in at another spot, cutting muscle and ligaments to release pressure and cutting into one of my hamstrings so I wouldn't loose the ability to walk. Recovery for that was terrible. I couldn't walk, couldn't shoot, couldn't do much of anything. I gained probably 40 pounds over my 3 month recovery. I had finally recovered from it and was back in swing and ready for my first big event with my friends. It was an annual ball that the rotc puts on and I was finnally back with my family, couldn't do much but back. I remeber that night because it was one of the last times I felt complete. I was invites to another party a week after but I had to turn it down, my leg wasn't ready and I just couldn't.  I went to sleep early and woke up with over 100 notifications. Come to find out my best friend who had invited me the night before had gotten in an accidnet and died on the way home.I was shaken to my core. His back up driver was shit faced and killed him and it was all becuase I wasn't there. A month later I was at his funeral and we were able to give him a send off to be proud of, all I remember was crying. I had lost one of my two bestfriends, the people who stood by me and had to torn apart relationships in the process of grieving. That excat night another tragedy struck, the third in our trio, a friend of mine sense elementary had passed away from complications with the flu. I was absolutely devastated. I couldn't function. Both of my pillars just died within a month of eachother. I threw myself into shooting and my coach. He was all the support I had left. Fast forward 6 months to the summer. My surgeon had just told me the day before that my other leg needed the same procedure and I could no longer be eligible for military service, the next day I rolled my car down a 30 foot embankment trying to swerve around two dogs. Once I was out of the hospital my coach called me to check on me and told me we would get breakfast after his hiking trip. My coach was epileptic but always loved to go on adventures, he was the classic Jersey stereotype with a heart of gold. I loved that man with everything I had. He was all I felt I had left. He ended up having an episode while hiking and fell of the side of a cliff,  they found his body the next morning on a rock on the river. I was completely devistated, I didnt know what to do but luckily I had made one more friend that I could talk too. I got my second surgery and gained more weight from the depression and lack of movement. This guy became my best friend, helped me through alot and let me vent to him. Flashforward to last month. He is on trial for child sex abuse and has confessdd to it but is now fighting it. I know he is guilty and being a victim of sexual abuse as a child I hate him for it. One of my last friends raped and abused his fathers girlfriend's daughter for years. Here I am now in college across the state and I am beyond lost with no true direction to follow. I want to go home and live closer to my family, but I am engaged and she is from the same town I lived in. We both want to move but aren't sure what to do.

,depression,"I haven’t felt this way in so long but the thoughts came back today, and I want to *literally slit my wrists into fucking shreds*. I always think the thoughts are truly gone and then sporadic episodes like these make me so disappointed in myself. I feel like a complete waste of space and wallow in self-pity and sad songs for a few hours until the trigger dies. Ironically I was just talking about how I felt better, and while I don’t *have* depression anymore it still hides in corners and tiptoes and jump-scares me when I least expect it.

I've been depressed for about 6 years, little moments of hope and temporary happiness here and there when I briefly connect with people.

,depression,"This is my first post and I don’t know if anyone will care to read this but I’m gonna post it anyways. I’ve had clinical depression for the past couple years now and I think everyone can relate the the feeling of hopelessness. Thinking “if things were like this I would feel better”. “If only.....”. “I would be so much happier if ....”. But you end up thinking yourself in hole of sadness and feeling like there’s nothing you can do to fix it and the cycle repeats and nothing changes.

This is how I mainly experience my depression. And lately I’ve been making changes in my life that’s been helping me and I hope this can help someone of you find a way to not get rid of your depression, but cope with it and find a way to tackle it everyday.

Warning: this is what I do personally to help me. I’m not saying this is the right way for everyone but I encourage you to try some of the ways I handle day to day life.


1) Most important of all: Get out of bed. 

Just get out. Say to yourself 1, 2, 3, and stand up on 3. There’s something you can be doing besides laying in bed. I have to tell myself everyday no matter how much I want to sit in bed and do nothing and just sleep and not think about my problems, I know I can’t because I won’t be happy that way. There’s something you could be doing to make your day seem productive and like you got something accomplished for that day. Do laundry. Go for a run. Clean the dishes. Read a book. Do that one thing you’ve been putting off but won’t even take that long to do. The high you can get from having a fulfilling day feeling like you’ve been productive and done something is incomparable to anything I’ve ever experienced

2) Talk to someone. 

No matter how much you want to be reclusive and just keep to yourself I can not express how important having social bonds and commuting with others is. I don’t care if you don’t have friends, most of us really don’t. Literally talk to your coworker. Strike up a convo with someone in the grocery line waiting to checkout. Hell have a conversation with your Uber driver. Communication and expressing thoughts are such an important part of mental health and talking to people always makes me feel like none of us are truly alone in this world, we are all part of a collective group just trying to get through what we call “life” together.

3)Remind yourself everyday that you are worthy. 

This is the hardest thing I struggle with. When good things happen to me instead of feeling happy I feel sad. “I don’t deserve this” “I’m not suppose to feel happy” “I’m not worthy of this”. You are worthy. You are worthy of living. You are worthy of love. You are worthy of attention. You’re not the useless piece of shit you think you are. We all deserve happiness. This is essential to live a fulfilling life. I cannot stress this enough

ALL of this is easier said that done and I 1000% realize that. I know because it took me forever to start doing these things after I realize what was truly making me depressed. I hope some of you though found inspiration in this and try some of these out.

Just get out. Say to yourself 1, 2, 3, and stand up on 3. There’s something you can be doing besides laying in bed. I have to tell myself everyday no matter how much I want to sit in bed and do nothing and just sleep and not think about my problems, I know I can’t because I won’t be happy that way. There’s something you could be doing to make your day seem productive and like you got something accomplished for that day. Do laundry. Go for a run. Clean the dishes. Read a book. Do that one thing you’ve been putting off but won’t even take that long to do. The high you can get from having a fulfilling day feeling like you’ve been productive and done something is incomparable to anything I’ve ever experienced

2) Talk to someone. 

No matter how much you want to be reclusive and just keep to yourself I can not express how important having social bonds and commuting with others is. I don’t care if you don’t have friends, most of us really don’t. Literally talk to your coworker. Strike up a convo with someone in the grocery line waiting to checkout. Hell have a conversation with your Uber driver. Communication and expressing thoughts are such an important part of mental health and talking to people always makes me feel like none of us are truly alone in this world, we are all part of a collective group just trying to get through what we call “life” together.

3)Remind yourself everyday that you are worthy. 

This is the hardest thing I struggle with. When good things happen to me instead of feeling happy I feel sad. “I don’t deserve this” “I’m not suppose to feel happy” “I’m not worthy of this”. You are worthy. You are worthy of living. You are worthy of love. You are worthy of attention. You’re not the useless piece of shit you think you are. We all deserve happiness. This is essential to live a fulfilling life. I cannot stress this enough

ALL of this is easier said that done and I 1000% realize that. I know because it took me forever to start doing these things after I realize what was truly making me depressed. I hope some of you though found inspiration in this and try some of these out.

Thank you :)How I overcome and cope with my depression everyday- hope this helps you guys too"

,depression,"Im from the UK. I got some crippling depression and anxiety going on the last 5 years. Had a bit of a breakdown 2 years ago and kinda tried to get help. As in i tried making an appointment to see a doctor. I ring up the doctors to make an appointment with the doctor and she asks whats wrong with me, like i aint teh fuckin doctor bruh, i also dont feel comfortable talking to someone about personal shit over the phone when i cant see them really. But I did answer her saying im depressed. But i wasnt allowed an appointment and got a 5 minute chat with a doctor over the phone. He asked a few questions which i answered and he prescribed me citalopram to take for a month and said to be in touch after i finish it. He also mailed me some leaflet about therapy/counselling (whatever the fuck it is), which i never read. I guess because i didnt think it would help me and I have pretty bad anxiety about making phonecalls, i will avoid it at all costs. So i was never gonna willingly ring them again. The whole experinece made me uncomfortable tbh and so i never went back. 

I have no major underlying traumas that are a cause of my illness, ie im not grieving or out, would therapy still benefit me? Like i just dont see how talking about how i feel would help anything. My feelings are irrational and not normal, i want to stop them not talk about them. 

I wish there was like a nhs online service where you could do a live chat. Im just no good at talking/speaking, and saying how i feel. It's just never gonna happen.

Its weird, if youre of a healthy mind but you found a cancer lump or something, you're all set, as in the nhs has all the procedures, medicine, technology, facilities etc to sort you out, you just make the phonecall for an appointment say you think you have a cancer lump.

,depression,"Warning: this is VERY long. I'm not sure what the purpose of it really is but just wanting to put this out there in the world. Maybe I'll get some advice, maybe someone will read it and realize they are not alone.

I’ve started writing this so many times and lost motivation half way through. This is yet another attempt, let’s see what happens.

I’m a 30 year old woman, I work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in Graphic Design, volunteer at a cat rescue 2 days a week, and suffer from depression and social/general anxiety disorder.

I first realized my teen angst wasn’t just a “phase” sometime in my early 20’s. As a teenager I would do the normal things: drink, do drugs, smoke weed. I would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. I’ve since lost that precious notebook, but I did come upon snippets of that “poetry” in my other sketchbooks. The stuff wasn’t anything out of the ordinary - I grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music - and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. I lost interest in that activity around the age of 20.

I was always a shy person. I played with friends during school, but I was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone’s house. As a result, I was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. My parents brought me to Canada when I was 9 years old in order to expand my options for education. I was born in Russia where there wasn’t much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. In that aspect, I thank them. I was able to attend an art school in Toronto and attain my Graphic Design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates.

When I arrived in Canada I didn’t speak much English and was in an ESL program. In that first year, 4th grade, I was bullied for not speaking the language. Some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks (the little pebbles from the playground) down my pants while we had “carpet time” (when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson.) They knew I wouldn’t say anything, partly because I couldn’t physically, partly because I couldn’t mentally. Kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. I brushed it off, went on with it. I did have two great friends (one of which is still in my life albeit we aren’t close.)

This childish bullying subsided after the first year. I went off to another school in grade 5 after moving buildings with my parents. 6th grade was split. It was yet another school (moving from elementary to middle school) and then half way through 6th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, I was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. I had to start over with the friend thing and luckily I befriended a girl right away. She was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also didn’t fit in with the “cool popular kids.” Here I was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having 1 friend, and being so extremely shy. After a while I became close with another girl, let’s call her Jessica. 7th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. I was also developing extremely bad acne, so I was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years.

Ending of 8th grade is where the real trouble started with Jessica. She had an “in” with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, I got to hang out with the group occasionally. This is where we started “relationships” with two boys. She was with lets call him Andrew and I was with let’s call him Mike. We would hang out after school a lot and one day I brought them all over to my house. Mike took me down to my parent’s cellar at one point and where I thought I would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. I didn’t know how to retaliate so I went with it. Instead of a first kiss, I gave my first hand job. The next time we hung out was at the movies. I was brought to the bathroom for what I thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. I can’t remember whether I went through with it, I just remember crying that evening. I soon found out that Andrew and Mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and Jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. These things bled into high school. The rumours started that I was a slut and were reinforced with photos being distributed throughout the school. The photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that Jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun “fashion” night. She wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got distributed. 

Finally a new girl came to the school lets call her Beth and finally things seemed to calm down. We had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school (to the point where people were calling us lesbians.) I even attended her wedding two years ago, she’s a beautiful human being. I tried my best to have a normal life. I threw myself into art. I would come to school at 7 in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab. I got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. Of course throughout this time I did the regular teenage girl stuff. I liked boys, I would make out with them. I was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. I just did it. It made them happy. And in my mind, that made me good at it. Why not do the thing that I felt I excelled at? Of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. 

I first tried drugs in 10th grade. Beth and I would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. This went on for about a year in the 11th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. I’m not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but I managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. At the end of 12th grade I met lets call him Sam. We dated for 2 years, I lost my virginity to him, but I will always remember doubting his intentions. Did he stay with me for the sex? Did he only want me around because I would smoke weed with him? It didn’t matter. I lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit I just didn’t want to, or couldn’t break.

I got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. After my break up with Sam, I met lets call him Dale. It was interesting at first. He would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. He brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. I now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. He wouldn’t take no for an answer even if I didn’t really feel like doing anything. The thing with Dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. We were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. I was starting to get really put off by him, but one night he insisted on hanging out. As you well know by now, I have trouble saying no. So we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. (I know how shameful it is to drink and I drive. I know first hand because I almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode. I haven’t done it since and will never do it again.) We were in the car and I was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. But he wouldn’t stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. I did it just to make him shut up so I could go home. I haven’t seem him since them. I refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. To this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. 

The truly destructive behaviour started around 22 when I began to frequent parties. At first it was drinking, and a lot of it. Then I met a 28 year old man lets call him Izack. He was a DJ and very much into the rave party scene. It was with him when I tried coke for the first time at the age of 23 or 24. Lets just call the rest a blur. I would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. Long story short, I just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor’s heart. I loved Izack. He was older, had more experience, best sex I’ve ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. He lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. The sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. I would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict Russian parents. Then Izack started going on the road a lot more due to his DJ career flourishing. When he was away, I would come to his place and clean everything. I bought him a huge new TV for his room. I wanted him to come home to a beautiful place. In my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week. 

About a year into our relationship, I went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that I have an STD. They told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. It was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pills but I had to have a serious conversation with Izack. He swore on his life that he never cheated on me. He begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, I finally did. But I never got over the nagging feeling that something wasn’t right. So after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday (I remember that day so clearly), I asked him one more time. I’m not sure what made him tell me truth this time around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how I contracted the STD.

I was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. The drugs and alcohol increased. I went on Tinder and began my first sex binge. At one point I managed to sleep with 6 different men in one week. All I wanted to do was to forget the hurt and I didn’t know how. Again, all of this is very blurry so I can’t say the exact moment that Izack came back into my life but he did. I remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure, to finally say I forgive him and that I’m moving on. That meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. We then got “back together”, continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. I let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. I think this is where I learned how to numb my brain from hurt. I wasn’t mad at him anymore, I just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on Tinder. After a few months of this, I met a guy lets call him Jon. 

We dated for something close to a year. This relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. But at this point I didn’t want another life. The relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. For example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage. I was told I was crazy on an almost daily basis. I will fast forward to the end, where a girl (who is now a friend) reached out to me saying that she was also dating Jon, for 6 months now. She spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. Apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. It turns out, that we weren’t the only ones. I came to the knowledge that he had slept with 8 different people during the span of being with me. This included his upstairs neighbour who I was constantly told not to worry about. 

I laughed at this. I didn’t cry, I didn’t feel angry, I laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next Tinder binge I went.

It took me about 6 months to get into my next relationship. This one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. It lasted for about 2 years. I met his parents and he met mine. We were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. We just weren’t right for each other.

So this is where I am now. 30 years old, living back with my parents. I have since stopped the partying because that life doesn’t satisfy me anymore and my body can’t handle it. I have been coke free for about a year now mainly because I can’t afford it. But I drink. I drink several times a week because I can’t stand my job. I drink because I feel trapped in my own mind. I drink because of my living situation. I drink because nothing I do excites me. I drink about 3 times a week and once I crack a bottle of wine, there is no way I can stop. That bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until I pass out. 

The job thing - realized I’m the only one who can help myself there so I have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just isn’t an option. I go to work, I laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that I took forward to is that next drink. I started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but I always fall off the boat because I can’t stay excited and motivated. 

Last night I came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad. My mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldn’t find my cat, or so she says. She then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so I had hidden. Long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and I am terrified. I feel like I have nothing happy to come home to. I spent all last night crying and today is the first day I didn’t show up to work because of this. The thing is - I don’t know if I want to stop. I’ve had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. I’ve cut myself on numerous occasions. I have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. I did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. My dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer I’m not sure I want to take. I just want it to be over. The only times things are okay in my brain is when I am sleeping, or when I am heavily buzzed. I don’t have children, nor a boyfriend and I have maybe 2 friends, so I’m finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. 

I would like to finish by saying how awful I feel about putting this out there. The amount of times the word “I” is used is upsetting and selfish since I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. Like my parents have pointed out numerous times, I have nothing to be sad about. I have a good job, a warm house, food and water. I have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. And they are right. I have it so good. But inside, that dark cloud just won’t lift and there is no way I can describe it in words to someone who hasn’t felt the pull of it.

I haven’t seem him since them. I refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. To this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truly destructive behaviour started around 22 when I began to frequent parties. At first it was drinking, and a lot of it. Then I met a 28 year old man lets call him Izack. He was a DJ and very much into the rave party scene. It was with him when I tried coke for the first time at the age of 23 or 24. Lets just call the rest a blur. I would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. Long story short, I just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor’s heart. I loved Izack. He was older, had more experience, best sex I’ve ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. He lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. The sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. I would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict Russian parents. Then Izack started going on the road a lot more due to his DJ career flourishing. When he was away, I would come to his place and clean everything. I bought him a huge new TV for his room. I wanted him to come home to a beautiful place. In my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year into our relationship, I went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that I have an STD. They told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. It was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pills but I had to have a serious conversation with Izack. He swore on his life that he never cheated on me. He begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, I finally did. But I never got over the nagging feeling that something wasn’t right. So after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday (I remember that day so clearly), I asked him one more time. I’m not sure what made him tell me truth this time around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how I contracted the STD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. The drugs and alcohol increased. I went on Tinder and began my first sex binge. At one point I managed to sleep with 6 different men in one week. All I wanted to do was to forget the hurt and I didn’t know how. Again, all of this is very blurry so I can’t say the exact moment that Izack came back into my life but he did. I remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure, to finally say I forgive him and that I’m moving on. That meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. We then got “back together”, continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. I let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. I think this is where I learned how to numb my brain from hurt. I wasn’t mad at him anymore, I just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on Tinder. After a few months of this, I met a guy lets call him Jon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We dated for something close to a year. This relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. But at this point I didn’t want another life. The relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. For example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage. I was told I was crazy on an almost daily basis. I will fast forward to the end, where a girl (who is now a friend) reached out to me saying that she was also dating Jon, for 6 months now. She spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. Apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. It turns out, that we weren’t the only ones. I came to the knowledge that he had slept with 8 different people during the span of being with me. This included his upstairs neighbour who I was constantly told not to worry about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laughed at this. I didn’t cry, I didn’t feel angry, I laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next Tinder binge I went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me about 6 months to get into my next relationship. This one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. It lasted for about 2 years. I met his parents and he met mine. We were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. We just weren’t right for each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is where I am now. 30 years old, living back with my parents. I have since stopped the partying because that life doesn’t satisfy me anymore and my body can’t handle it. I have been coke free for about a year now mainly because I can’t afford it. But I drink. I drink several times a week because I can’t stand my job. I drink because I feel trapped in my own mind. I drink because of my living situation. I drink because nothing I do excites me. I drink about 3 times a week and once I crack a bottle of wine, there is no way I can stop. That bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until I pass out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job thing - realized I’m the only one who can help myself there so I have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just isn’t an option. I go to work, I laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that I took forward to is that next drink. I started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but I always fall off the boat because I can’t stay excited and motivated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad. My mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldn’t find my cat, or so she says. She then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so I had hidden. Long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and I am terrified. I feel like I have nothing happy to come home to. I spent all last night crying and today is the first day I didn’t show up to work because of this. The thing is - I don’t know if I want to stop. I’ve had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. I’ve cut myself on numerous occasions. I have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. I did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. My dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer I’m not sure I want to take. I just want it to be over. The only times things are okay in my brain is when I am sleeping, or when I am heavily buzzed. I don’t have children, nor a boyfriend and I have maybe 2 friends, so I’m finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to finish by saying how awful I feel about putting this out there. The amount of times the word “I” is used is upsetting and selfish since I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. Like my parents have pointed out numerous times, I have nothing to be sad about. I have a good job, a warm house, food and water. I have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. And they are right. I have it so good. But inside, that dark cloud just won’t lift and there is no way I can describe it in words to someone who hasn’t felt the pull of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, from the bottom of my heart to anyone who read this fully, attempted to read it, or even glanced at it. I am very scared and for some reason the only thing I thought of this morning was writing this.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not sure what the purpose of it really is but just wanting to put this out there in the world. Maybe I'll get some advice, maybe someone will read it and realize they are not alone.

I’ve started writing this so many times and lost motivation half way through. This is yet another attempt, let’s see what happens.

I’m a 30 year old woman, I work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in Graphic Design, volunteer at a cat rescue 2 days a week, and suffer from depression and social/general anxiety disorder.

I first realized my teen angst wasn’t just a “phase” sometime in my early 20’s. As a teenager I would do the normal things: drink, do drugs, smoke weed. I would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. I’ve since lost that precious notebook, but I did come upon snippets of that “poetry” in my other sketchbooks. The stuff wasn’t anything out of the ordinary - I grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music - and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. I lost interest in that activity around the age of 20.

I was always a shy person. I played with friends during school, but I was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone’s house. As a result, I was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. My parents brought me to Canada when I was 9 years old in order to expand my options for education. I was born in Russia where there wasn’t much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. In that aspect, I thank them. I was able to attend an art school in Toronto and attain my Graphic Design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates.

When I arrived in Canada I didn’t speak much English and was in an ESL program. In that first year, 4th grade, I was bullied for not speaking the language. Some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks (the little pebbles from the playground) down my pants while we had “carpet time” (when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson.) They knew I wouldn’t say anything, partly because I couldn’t physically, partly because I couldn’t mentally. Kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. I brushed it off, went on with it. I did have two great friends (one of which is still in my life albeit we aren’t close.)

This childish bullying subsided after the first year. I went off to another school in grade 5 after moving buildings with my parents. 6th grade was split. It was yet another school (moving from elementary to middle school) and then half way through 6th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, I was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. I had to start over with the friend thing and luckily I befriended a girl right away. She was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also didn’t fit in with the “cool popular kids.” Here I was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having 1 friend, and being so extremely shy. After a while I became close with another girl, let’s call her Jessica. 7th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. I was also developing extremely bad acne, so I was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years.

Ending of 8th grade is where the real trouble started with Jessica. She had an “in” with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, I got to hang out with the group occasionally. This is where we started “relationships” with two boys. She was with lets call him Andrew and I was with let’s call him Mike. We would hang out after school a lot and one day I brought them all over to my house. Mike took me down to my parent’s cellar at one point and where I thought I would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. I didn’t know how to retaliate so I went with it. Instead of a first kiss, I gave my first hand job. The next time we hung out was at the movies. I was brought to the bathroom for what I thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. I can’t remember whether I went through with it, I just remember crying that evening. I soon found out that Andrew and Mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and Jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. These things bled into high school. The rumours started that I was a slut and were reinforced with photos being distributed throughout the school. The photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that Jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun “fashion” night. She wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got distributed. 

Finally a new girl came to the school lets call her Beth and finally things seemed to calm down. We had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school (to the point where people were calling us lesbians.) I even attended her wedding two years ago, she’s a beautiful human being. I tried my best to have a normal life. I threw myself into art. I would come to school at 7 in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab. I got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. Of course throughout this time I did the regular teenage girl stuff. I liked boys, I would make out with them. I was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. I just did it. It made them happy. And in my mind, that made me good at it. Why not do the thing that I felt I excelled at? Of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. 

I first tried drugs in 10th grade. Beth and I would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. This went on for about a year in the 11th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. I’m not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but I managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. At the end of 12th grade I met lets call him Sam. We dated for 2 years, I lost my virginity to him, but I will always remember doubting his intentions. Did he stay with me for the sex? Did he only want me around because I would smoke weed with him? It didn’t matter. I lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit I just didn’t want to, or couldn’t break.

I got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. After my break up with Sam, I met lets call him Dale. It was interesting at first. He would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. He brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. I now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. He wouldn’t take no for an answer even if I didn’t really feel like doing anything. The thing with Dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. We were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. I was starting to get really put off by him, but one night he insisted on hanging out. As you well know by now, I have trouble saying no. So we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. (I know how shameful it is to drink and I drive. I know first hand because I almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode. I haven’t done it since and will never do it again.) We were in the car and I was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. But he wouldn’t stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. I did it just to make him shut up so I could go home. I haven’t seem him since them. I refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. To this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous.

I was in a really good place for about 4 months .I was so sure that I would never feel the way I felt when I had a major depressive episode again ,that I would not fall back into that dark pit .And I was so proud of myself for overcoming depression.

   At first, I thought I was doing just fine.But then i caught myself having persistent thoughts that once made me decide to take my own life .Then I found myself having difficulty concentrating on my studies ,even though I absolutely love studying and learning new things .Then I started sleeping too much because the incessant flow of thoughts and overthinking made me feel exhausted  .The headaches started.Getting out of bed was becoming more and more difficult.And at a certain point I was so overwhelmed by my feelings that I just literally turned my emotions off .I didn’t feel anything .I felt numb and empty.I guess i kind of felt like I had to resort to turning  the emotions off  because keeping up an act of being ok with all the thoughts eating away at me all the time was difficult as hell.My mom started noticing that I was skipping school and staying in my bed all day instead .I could tell she was afraid that I was in a really dark place again.And I just couldn’t put her through that pain again.She suffered enough because of me.So I numbed my feeling and started attending school regularly .The whole numbing my emotions thing was working out just fine for me.I went to school .I didn’t think about anything ,I didn’t feel anything ,it’s like I was there but my mind was somewhere else .

,depression,"Hi, first time user here. I've read post before I finally worked my way to making an account, and wanted to let this out. 

Been depressed almost 10yrs. Looking back, I was never close to anyone to speak about being suicidal. The few the knew about it, didn't seem to take me seriously. 

Only child, moved a lot between schools, so my friendships never lasted. Plus my parents were very strict, so I couldn't visit any of them anyways, nor were they allowed to come over. 

Shitty childhood/teenage life. Been in relationships where my kindness was used, been cheated on, those I was infatuated with never seen me the same way. I'd always think I'm the problem or the reason things never work out. I'm not worth fighting for or keeping for the long run.

I always thought I'd die before I'm 25. I'm 26. I still feel strongly about leaving this place. I wish I can just sleep and then just shut down completely. Just die peacefully. Sadly life doesn't work that way, because ya know, life isn't fair.

,depression,"Well today I went for my first initial evaluation with a specialized psychiatrist since I was a kid (I'm 24). 
I mean I went to my University's student health and saw the psychiatrist there and got therapy through the psych service at school.
But this was my first seeing one not through a school. The kind with the leather couch and had classical music playing.

Anyway, I wasn't nervous like I said University blah blah blah. I went in confident just had to do the pre eval and just get my meds filled there. Well that's not what happened.

After an hour he sits back and I ask him how I'm looking. He said that he wanted to recommend inpatient. That was the first shock. (Idk why it was a shock I just never thought I needed it)

The second was after I told him about visual and auditory hallucinations (which I thought was normal because Uni doc didn't seemed phased). He told me he would right up a report but that I may have Psychotic Depression.

Now it may not seem like a big change from just having Major Depression Disorder, but idk.

,depression,"
That's what I felt when I thought about you. Hope for the future, because I knew no matter what, I'd have you by my side. We were damn near perfect for each other, and I loved you more than anything. The day I met you, I knew I was going to fall for you. How could I stop myself? You were beautiful. Your perfect smile, curly brown hair, and those eyes that seemed to look right into my soul, it was all so intoxicating. Life was beyond perfect and I spent my days with you on my mind. 


When my Da died, you were there. You held me when I cried, you were perfect. When I left for the funeral, that's when things changed. I began to fall apart. I came back to school, and I spent every minute of the day with you. I was depressed and you made me feel better. I was failing all my classes, but I didn't care because I'd rather be with you. Then, you left. You moved out, you lied to me about why. I met your mother, although you were rather weird about it. You drove off without kissing me, which threw me off. 

I got to see you the next day, meet your friends. I loved spending time with you, being part of your life, and I loved your friends. I was excited to be around this more. When I totaled my car, that was the last time I meant anything to you. You had taken everything I had to give, and other than sex I was worthless. When we talked on the phone it felt forced, and I was scared I was gonna lose you.

 When January came around, I was excited. I was doing well in school, and your birthday was coming up. I had a surprise for you. You thought you were just staying the night with me, but I was going to take you skiing, because you had never seen snow before. But the night before, you barely talked to me. I tried to call you, but you brushed me off. I barely slept that night, I was so excited to get to spend time with you. But when I woke up, you hadn't left. An hour rolled around, then two, and I called you. Straight to voicemail. I texted you, and you didn't respond. Around noon you finally woke up. That's when it began to end. You told me you had tried to kill yourself the night before. I was so shocked, but I didn't let it bother me. I comforted you and asked you what you wanted me to do. The next day, I borrowed my roommates car and drove to the hospital to see you. I wanted to surprise you. I had your Christmas presents, which you insisted you didn't want. I texted your sister and asked her what room you were in, and she asked what I meant. I asked if you had gotten out of the hospital and she said you were never in the hospital. That's when I saw it. You had slipped up, and your friend had put a post on Instagram. You with your boyfriend. Only it wasn't me. It never was me. From the beginning, you had been lying. I called you and I asked one thing. Why? Why would you do this to me? I wish you would've reacted any other way. You started crying. You told me how sorry you were. I asked if your sister knew, and that's when I found out. You had been lying to everyone. I wanted so badly to tell everyone, but I didn't. I wondered what else you had been lying about so I asked your sister, and I found out that you had made up almost everything about yourself, even your last name. 

So now I'm left in this position. I'm in love with someone who doesn't exist. That person you made up, she still haunts my dreams. I still hear her laughter and I wake up reaching for her. But she's not real, just a persona that you made up to get what you wanted. Regardless, I still see your face at night. So look at what you've done. Are you proud? You've done what nobody else could. After everything else that I've gone through, this was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

I'm a broken man now. There's no doubt about it. I barely sleep, I eat maybe 3 times a week, and I rarely leave my room. I wake up calling out your name now as well as Da's. So now I'm dropping out of college, it's ironic that it's for the exact same reason you told the school. Clinical depression. I've lost my hope, my desire for the future. I have no drive, I stopped talking to people, and I just yesterday told my family that I need help. So I'm going to get better, I'm going to be successful and happy and do everything I can to forget about you.

Then, you left. You moved out, you lied to me about why. I met your mother, although you were rather weird about it. You drove off without kissing me, which threw me off. 

I got to see you the next day, meet your friends. I loved spending time with you, being part of your life, and I loved your friends. I was excited to be around this more. When I totaled my car, that was the last time I meant anything to you. You had taken everything I had to give, and other than sex I was worthless. When we talked on the phone it felt forced, and I was scared I was gonna lose you.

 When January came around, I was excited. I was doing well in school, and your birthday was coming up. I had a surprise for you. You thought you were just staying the night with me, but I was going to take you skiing, because you had never seen snow before. But the night before, you barely talked to me. I tried to call you, but you brushed me off. I barely slept that night, I was so excited to get to spend time with you. But when I woke up, you hadn't left. An hour rolled around, then two, and I called you. Straight to voicemail. I texted you, and you didn't respond. Around noon you finally woke up. That's when it began to end. You told me you had tried to kill yourself the night before. I was so shocked, but I didn't let it bother me. I comforted you and asked you what you wanted me to do. The next day, I borrowed my roommates car and drove to the hospital to see you. I wanted to surprise you. I had your Christmas presents, which you insisted you didn't want. I texted your sister and asked her what room you were in, and she asked what I meant. I asked if you had gotten out of the hospital and she said you were never in the hospital. That's when I saw it. You had slipped up, and your friend had put a post on Instagram. You with your boyfriend. Only it wasn't me. It never was me. From the beginning, you had been lying. I called you and I asked one thing. Why? Why would you do this to me? I wish you would've reacted any other way. You started crying. You told me how sorry you were. I asked if your sister knew, and that's when I found out. You had been lying to everyone. I wanted so badly to tell everyone, but I didn't. I wondered what else you had been lying about so I asked your sister, and I found out that you had made up almost everything about yourself, even your last name. 

So now I'm left in this position. I'm in love with someone who doesn't exist. That person you made up, she still haunts my dreams. I still hear her laughter and I wake up reaching for her. But she's not real, just a persona that you made up to get what you wanted. Regardless, I still see your face at night. So look at what you've done. Are you proud? You've done what nobody else could. After everything else that I've gone through, this was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

I'm a broken man now. There's no doubt about it. I barely sleep, I eat maybe 3 times a week, and I rarely leave my room. I wake up calling out your name now as well as Da's. So now I'm dropping out of college, it's ironic that it's for the exact same reason you told the school. Clinical depression. I've lost my hope, my desire for the future. I have no drive, I stopped talking to people, and I just yesterday told my family that I need help. So I'm going to get better, I'm going to be successful and happy and do everything I can to forget about you. But late at night, when I lay, walking the line between sleep and consciousness, I know I'll still see them. Those eyes, looking right into my soul.Hope"

One thing in particular he said about depression really made me change my 'point of view' of my depression and anxiety. He explains how we can seperate 'ourselves' from our self-identification of the depression.

a short part of one of his talks goes something like this:

Person A: I'm really deeply depressed.
Person B: Are you noticing your depression?
Person A: The noticer is just noticing.
Person B: Is the noticer depressed?
Person A: well no, it's just noticing. 

The lesson is to climb into the noticer more and more. Reduce your self identification with the depression.Awareness of depression"
,depression,"For all my life the thing that i have always wanted to do is to stab myself in the chest and just see what happens when I die. All the things I liked doing, I dont enjoy anymore. I think all my ""friends"" hold a grudge against me, and i do not know what for.

In person it would take you some telepathy to really see that there is something wrong with me. I've learnt to hide, as we all have. It hasn't been 2 day or 2 weeks or few months that I have had those kind of thoughts.

Everyone I know has or is talking behind my back, I have heard rumours that I smoke, drink, use drugs, take steroids and a handfull of things that I can't begin to explain. I am only 17, my middle school was nothing but me being bullied or made fun off, being used or treated as trash. In high school I had a crush on a girl from my class, we were texting, getting to know each other n stuff.... Just how much do I regret ever noticing that this human being even existed, if i could go back and just skip the part with her it would be the best thing.

My home aint a better place either, father is a drinker, sister is a little brat, my mother struggles to make ends meet since my father is a piece of shit, so I do my best to help with whatever I can. I am grateful that I have a bed to sleep in, though it aint always warm.. I am great I have food on the table. I am ashamed of how my home looks so I never have invited someone over.

Solitude is all I know, I have become to be uncomfortable around other people, just because I fear someone would pierce or see thru the shell of the cool and chill dude that makes everybody laugh, and will see what a mess he is when he gets a little privacy.

I am sitting in bed listening to sad songs crying my eyes out for no reason at all, I am really thinking about ending it all tonight. Tho I wonder will someone beside my mom and sister care that I will be dead? My abscense wont make a difference in anyone's life at all. Would anyone even care at all. My existence doesnt matter at all, and if that's the case why should it continue, why not end it tonight. I have promised my mother not to kill myself, but it is really hard to keep the promise.

,depression,"I'm at a cross roads. Yesterday, I had a mid term and showed up 50 minutes late. I had actually gotten up that morning to go and take it (my mom took the car extra early and came back late even though I told her that I needed to be at school). Unfortunately this didnt help the fact that I havent been attending school or doing the hwks and labs. My programming professor understood and gave me the slip to go back to do the labs and hwks that I missed. Though again, yesterday I was told that I'm approaching the deadline for this consideration very close and was suggested to take a medical withdrawal by my professor. This year just isnt my year. I feel withdrawn from everything and just cant bring myself to hold onto the shread of stability. Me missing my classes is also something I told my therapist and psychiatrist about. 

My professor wants to hold a meeting with me and my academic advisor to see if there is a way to avoid medical withdrawal and catch up on assignments. I appreciated the consideration until early today, when I realized that I most likely wont be attending lab today either. I cant keep doing this. This is the second time I've taken this class and its gotten admittedly worse. The first time was alright but this time...is terrible. I dont have a support group like last time and I dont have a team. My first time, I was turning in assignments but the lack on my part was not studying for the midterm but I still had a long stride of actually passing then. I feel so uncomfortable in class, I feel like a foreigner.  I get sad because it's  as if I have no idea what's going on around me and it makes me so sad. 

I have a sibling who faced this problem when she tried attending college. She got depressed, started sleeping in and never leaving for school. I dont know why we cant stay in college and actually graduate but it seems like a curse. 


If I leave school, I'm faced with having to leave my school job. If I lose my school job, I wont have any funds. My mother will be leaving me in our hometown and I wont be able to get help from her like I need . I know that if i withdraw, i wont be able to withdraw from one class, I'd have to leave all of them. I didnt have the best if luck from finding work without school ties. So, I'm scared to leave school. I'm diagnosed with depression and GAD. I'd be anxiety ridden and depressed knowing that I'll be holding my grad year back and I wont be able to conjure up funds. 

I wanted to love school. I know I can love learning but I cant seem to love that or anything else right now. I was supposed to be graduating this year but I souldnt be anyway due to needing more classes to complete. I had planned on passing this semester and taking up extra summer classes go shorten time but ...that's all gone. 

I dont know what to do. Should I schedule this meeting in hope of finding options where I dont withdraw and end up pissing away at the possible opportunities? Or just withdrawal, be possibly homeless and come back to school when I'm better? Its hard making a living without a college degree and im worried. I want to stop the self sabotage of depression  but it's as if I can't.


I don't want to leave my home. I want to stay home all the time . I told my counselor this and it's as if she doesnt really get it. She makes it seem as if it's an easy fix and then I wont do it again. I hate the therapists I've had because they are very ineffective.

,depression,"So first of all, I don't know if this is a rule or not, but I've never been to a doctor's and actually got confirmed to have depression, I have anxiety issues and likely agoraphobia, I haven't left the house for 4 years, even then it only lasted a month, since before that I hadn't left the house in 5 years. Even before that, I didn't receive a high school education as I spent it all, you guessed it, in my house.

There was a small portion in my life where I actually had friends, 10 years ago, I was active, ""fun"", enjoying my life fairly well but occasionally I was still in the dumps. Most of my friends seemed to be the same way so we talked about it a lot. Of course my friend at the time tried to encourage me, tell me it gets better and kept an eye on me to make sure I was coming out of my shell so to say.

So of course I fucked that up, I made a small mistake, said sorry, they forgave me and I punished myself by not allowing myself to see my friends. Still haven't seen them to this day, besides one, my so. Somehow, they have infinite patience and can put up with all my shit.

I punished myself a lot, I'd cut myself, I'd punch and slam myself, destroy my own possessions. My so tried their best and it sort of fizzled out. These days I don't get the will to do so anymore.

Ever since then, nothing, for a whole 10 years, most of it I didn't even spend time with my mother and younger sister. Maybe I was still punishing myself. I had few hobbies or even things to do, though I didn't fully enjoy any of it, I was starting to feel pretty emotionless.
Towards the end I actually started reconnecting with my mother and finally learning stuff and just starting to connect with my sister.

It was going fairly well for me, I was starting to look at the bright side, I still never left my house but it was starting to feel comfortable instead of a prison.

But then my sister did something unspeakable, something I don't think I could ever forgive, but my mother did, instantly. I was hurt, angry and it pulled me straight back. Ever since I've been weird around my sister, finding it almost impossible to connect and angry at my mother.

So now, I just feel numb, I really don't know what to do, I've been trying to forgive and forget but it's impossible. I've been trying to go outside but I almost have panic attacks just thinking about it sometimes. I'm back to the prison with nothing to do but wait.

&lt;p&gt;Ever since then, nothing, for a whole 10 years, most of it I didn&amp;#39;t even spend time with my mother and younger sister. Maybe I was still punishing myself. I had few hobbies or even things to do, though I didn&amp;#39;t fully enjoy any of it, I was starting to feel pretty emotionless.
Towards the end I actually started reconnecting with my mother and finally learning stuff and just starting to connect with my sister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was going fairly well for me, I was starting to look at the bright side, I still never left my house but it was starting to feel comfortable instead of a prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then my sister did something unspeakable, something I don&amp;#39;t think I could ever forgive, but my mother did, instantly. I was hurt, angry and it pulled me straight back. Ever since I&amp;#39;ve been weird around my sister, finding it almost impossible to connect and angry at my mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, I just feel numb, I really don&amp;#39;t know what to do, I&amp;#39;ve been trying to forgive and forget but it&amp;#39;s impossible. I&amp;#39;ve been trying to go outside but I almost have panic attacks just thinking about it sometimes. I&amp;#39;m back to the prison with nothing to do but wait.&lt;/p&gt;

Even before that, I didn't receive a high school education as I spent it all, you guessed it, in my house.

There was a small portion in my life where I actually had friends, 10 years ago, I was active, ""fun"", enjoying my life fairly well but occasionally I was still in the dumps.

Of course my friend at the time tried to encourage me, tell me it gets better and kept an eye on me to make sure I was coming out of my shell so to say.

So of course I fucked that up, I made a small mistake, said sorry, they forgave me and I punished myself by not allowing myself to see my friends. Still haven't seen them to this day, besides one, my so. Somehow, they have infinite patience and can put up with all my shit.

,depression," 

I just moved into my first apartment ""of my own"" at 33 (almost 35 years old) - granted it's ""section-8"" housing paid for largely if not mostly by the state specifically for people w/ disabilities - but that's beside the point...) ***ANYWAY***, I've got a big problem and I don't know how to get over it.

I should point out that I've probably posted here before in preparation for this move (it took 5 months between signing the lease and actually moving in and starting to live here - so bear with me if any of this sounds familiar.....if that bothers you, just please ignore it and move on rather than bothering me with ""trolling"".

Sorry, I got a bit off topic there for a minute. My problem is that I basically just sit in my apartment all day watching T.V. or playing games. I've met a handful of people either in the halls, or knocking on doors when I first moved in (just to introduce myself and ""say hi"" - which took a LOT of courage for me as I've got social anxiety and fear the heck out of getting out of my comfort zone.

At any rate, so far I've met (or at least casually said ""hi"" and at times attempted to start a conversation with to a ""handful"" of people either in the dining hall they have set up for the lunch program I'm signed up for or in the hallways. But I frankly can't find pretty much anyone I want to or am capable of even really having a conversation with letting alone really getting to know them. There was one guy that I liked, but he was like in a bad mood that day or is just really introverted (and that's coming from an ""uber-introvert"" LOL) or something like that - he didn't even want to offer up his name.

Having said that, here's my real problem (and likely the point where you all start to ""hate"" me lol/smh):

1. I'm admittedly somewhat ""bigoted"" if you will against PwD (""persons w/ disabilities"" for those unfamiliar with the acronym). A ""self-hating PwD"", if you will. It's NOT that I find anything inherently ""wrong"" or ""bad"" with PwD, so much as it is I'm so fucking god-damned sick and tired of being labeled as nothing BUT a PwD, and having us always being pigeonholed into having to spend time with one another, because ""normal"" (for lack of a better, more ""P.C."" term) society doesn't want anything to do with us and ""God forbid"" they actually want to make friends with us or spend time with us.
2. I will say, there are a number of people here that are either intellectually (***significantly***) ""below my level"" OR they have some sort of speech impediment (probably from some sort of issue with their brain that interferes with their brain's ability to produce speech or something like that sorry, I'm not an expert on those disabilities nor speaking apparently as this is a major run on sentence....sorry) - neither of which there is anything intrinsically wrong with whatsoever, but it DOES severely impact my ability to want to be friends with them or get to know them. I quite simply no longer have the patience anymore to try to get to know somebody who doesn't have the mental capacity to talk about anything more than her apparent obsession with ""kitties"" (true story, there is actually someone here who all she talks about is cats) or to try to discern what someone is saying every time they open their mouths because unfortunately they are so impaired mentally that they struggle to form coherent speech. That's like ***WELL*** over 50% of the people I've come across so far. And the ones who aren't impaired in those ways that I've met so far, are either significantly older than me (this apartment's average age I'd say is well over 50+ and I'm not yet 34) or we just have nothing in common as I'm obsessed with sports and movies and T.V. and I have yet to meet a single person here who has the same interests. (NOTE: Sorry I should've tried to found a way to break this up into more paragraphs, but couldn't figure out a good way to do so).

Now, mind you - I know damn well that my inherent biases and SUPER anti-social tendencies are playing a (big?) part here, but I just can't bring myself to find anybody here who I want to get to know or hang out with. For that matter, none of the people I ***have*** introduced myself to so far have bothered to call me or knock on my door or even say ""hi"" in passing me in the hallways.

I've thought about trying to find a way to ""get involved"" in the community *outside* of the building, but between my ""anti-social"" tendencies and fear running my life and scaring the shit out of me in that sense every way possible prohibiting me from doing it so far, the other problem I have with it, is there is basically only about a 3-hour window - maximum - that I want to fill during the **daytime** hours (roughly 12-ish to 4:45-ish, my shows start at 5:00).....including transportation, which having to rely on ""para-transit"", means I could spend most of that time waiting).

And even that time I could probably spend catching up with shows I've missed that I want to see on demand. Basically, as has been the case for as long as I can remember, I'm a T.V. (and computer) ADDICT - and I'm largely okay with it, except I know it's unhealthy and antisocial. Ideally, I'd LIKE to be more social, but between being addicted to my electronics and being scared to death of socializing and the prospect of socializing with a bunch of people in the building that quite frankly I don't seem to *want* to get to know (and they've certainly made no attempt to get to know me with the exception of one old lady who we don't have much in common, and she's already admitted that I'm a ""dick"" - which I already knew so I wasn't offended, the idea is less than appetizing. (NOTE: thankfully, she doesn't seem to mind that I'm a dick, but again we only ate lunch together one time and I never got her apartment number and I haven't seen her since).

So to make a long story short - how do I get over my fears, and out of my funk, while still maintaining the things I enjoy (like surfing the net and binge-ing on T.V.) ? I'm thinking about volunteering, but the last time I tried (before I moved) I seem to remember those places always want you to volunteer - understandably, for a lot more hours than I'm willing to commit to.

I'll end by saying (if anyone is even stil reading this ""TL;DR"" post at this point,) that there is no need to point out any sort of ""self-sabotaging"" or ""excuse making"" on my point.

&lt;p&gt;I should point out that I&amp;#39;ve probably posted here before in preparation for this move (it took 5 months between signing the lease and actually moving in and starting to live here - so bear with me if any of this sounds familiar.....if that bothers you, just please ignore it and move on rather than bothering me with &amp;quot;trolling&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I got a bit off topic there for a minute. My problem is that I basically just sit in my apartment all day watching T.V. or playing games. I&amp;#39;ve met a handful of people either in the halls, or knocking on doors when I first moved in (just to introduce myself and &amp;quot;say hi&amp;quot; - which took a LOT of courage for me as I&amp;#39;ve got social anxiety and fear the heck out of getting out of my comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any rate, so far I&amp;#39;ve met (or at least casually said &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot; and at times attempted to start a conversation with to a &amp;quot;handful&amp;quot; of people either in the dining hall they have set up for the lunch program I&amp;#39;m signed up for or in the hallways. But I frankly can&amp;#39;t find pretty much anyone I want to or am capable of even really having a conversation with letting alone really getting to know them. There was one guy that I liked, but he was like in a bad mood that day or is just really introverted (and that&amp;#39;s coming from an &amp;quot;uber-introvert&amp;quot; LOL) or something like that - he didn&amp;#39;t even want to offer up his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, here&amp;#39;s my real problem (and likely the point where you all start to &amp;quot;hate&amp;quot; me lol/smh):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m admittedly somewhat &amp;quot;bigoted&amp;quot; if you will against PwD (&amp;quot;persons w/ disabilities&amp;quot; for those unfamiliar with the acronym). A &amp;quot;self-hating PwD&amp;quot;, if you will. It&amp;#39;s NOT that I find anything inherently &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; with PwD, so much as it is I&amp;#39;m so fucking god-damned sick and tired of being labeled as nothing BUT a PwD, and having us always being pigeonholed into having to spend time with one another, because &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; (for lack of a better, more &amp;quot;P.C.&amp;quot; term) society doesn&amp;#39;t want anything to do with us and &amp;quot;God forbid&amp;quot; they actually want to make friends with us or spend time with us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will say, there are a number of people here that are either intellectually (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) &amp;quot;below my level&amp;quot; OR they have some sort of speech impediment (probably from some sort of issue with their brain that interferes with their brain&amp;#39;s ability to produce speech or something like that sorry, I&amp;#39;m not an expert on those disabilities nor speaking apparently as this is a major run on sentence....sorry) - neither of which there is anything intrinsically wrong with whatsoever, but it DOES severely impact my ability to want to be friends with them or get to know them. I quite simply no longer have the patience anymore to try to get to know somebody who doesn&amp;#39;t have the mental capacity to talk about anything more than her apparent obsession with &amp;quot;kitties&amp;quot; (true story, there is actually someone here who all she talks about is cats) or to try to discern what someone is saying every time they open their mouths because unfortunately they are so impaired mentally that they struggle to form coherent speech. That&amp;#39;s like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WELL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; over 50% of the people I&amp;#39;ve come across so far. And the ones who aren&amp;#39;t impaired in those ways that I&amp;#39;ve met so far, are either significantly older than me (this apartment&amp;#39;s average age I&amp;#39;d say is well over 50+ and I&amp;#39;m not yet 34) or we just have nothing in common as I&amp;#39;m obsessed with sports and movies and T.V. and I have yet to meet a single person here who has the same interests. (NOTE: Sorry I should&amp;#39;ve tried to found a way to break this up into more paragraphs, but couldn&amp;#39;t figure out a good way to do so).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, mind you - I know damn well that my inherent biases and SUPER anti-social tendencies are playing a (big?) part here, but I just can&amp;#39;t bring myself to find anybody here who I want to get to know or hang out with.

As I was walking I was so deep in my thoughts I didn't realize where I was going and bumped into someone. For the life of me, I bumped into the biggest jackass in my school.

,depression,"I posted it here and people didn't believe me back then, I cared about it before but I don't care anymore.

I'm serving in the military and I feel shit about it.
I feel broken inside, I changed in a very bad way.

I started having brake-downs and even wetting the bed.

I feel embarrassed, ashamed, and the worse part is that I still have 2 years left (I served 1 year so far).

I haven't told anyone about wetting the bed as I'm not 4 years old. And frankly speaking I just don't want to think about it.

My body is worthless, 6 feet tall and 130 lbs, nobody wants to date a skeleton, and if they do, maybe there is something wrong with them... I can get skinny people, but ones who are bony to the point of concern... I can't get why anyone would be attracted to me. Yet I somehow have a boyfriend.

,depression," English is not my first language. So some of the things that characterizes me I believe are: depression, sensitivity, sluggish cognitive tempo (sct), social anxiety and asd(have diagnosis).   I've convinced myself that my version of reality is warped and greatly limited compared to the average person. Dunno, maybe I'm just being delusional. I've completely abandoned my ego because possessing one takes me to a place I like to call the abyss. This basically gives me ignorant suffering. Okay, I'll try to explain this the best I can. Several regions of my brain appear to be inactive and it's always been like this since I've been born. Due to this and the things I've listed before, without sufficient self-awareness life can become quite miserable without me realizing it. I reject my experience of reality and started considering the possibility of everyone else being soulless except me. The perfect coping mechanism! I can't validate my version of the world or other people's existences. Even as I read your comments, it will literally turn into a feedback loop to be interpreted by my brain. So I pay close attention to my thoughts, feelings, inclinations, ambitions, point of view, emotions and basically reject them. I have this constant need for stimulation(think I may have inattentive adhd), otherwise I get bored, completely empty and start feeling really . Though denying the very core essence of my being requires so much brainpower due to things listed above, and due to poor memory, I start doubting my belief. All I want to do is turn into a recluse and live a life of self-indulgence completely cutting myself off of society for good.   


A problem that I often have is falling victim to the flow of others (like a toddler).  Have I lost a part of my psyche?

,depression,"I've suffered with depression my entire life and never did much to overcome it early on when I should have.  I will turn 30 soon and I have been addicted to porn since I was 12. I used porn as a safe coping mechanism so that I wouldn't have to deal with anything in life- improving social skills and having friendships, taking risks, developing hobbies, talking to girls and dating, going to college, traveling. Ive done none of these things. I've had a few menial jobs and have an apartment. That's it.

Now I have no job, I am a virgin and I have no friends. I just quit watching porn a month ago, but I am more depressed than I have ever been. This is because when I cut my coping mechanism being porn addiction out of your routine, reality hit me like a brick wall. Everything is bubbling to the surface and I am fully overwhelmed by the fact that I have completely wasted my young life. I see absolutely no positive reason to move forward. I have never felt this close to suicide being the only way out before. I am seeing shrinks about my problems and got put on meds recently this month.

But it's gotten to the point where I have no desire to improve myself AT ALL!! I can't get out of bed, can't eat. can't go outside. I have no passion to do anything. I know I can't commit suicide but I don't want to move or think.

I've been in a crisis unit at a local hospital 5 years ago and it did nothing to help me. All they did was put me on zoloft and made me sit in a bed and attend group meetings with drug addict for 2 weeks straight before they released me. All this did for me was numb the pain with medication and I was just as unhappy as I was before I went in.

So my question is what happens when you don't want to kill yourself, but you can't deal with digging yourself out of this rock bottom state? Is there a place where they will put you where you don't have to leave your bed? Psych ward or something?  I want to be put away forever. I can't deal with the uphill battle I will have to face in life and my regrets and hopelessness is way too strong to battle anymore. I do not have any strength left to improve myself at all.

All they did was put me on zoloft and made me sit in a bed and attend group meetings with drug addict for 2 weeks straight before they released me. All this did for me was numb the pain with medication and I was just as unhappy as I was before I went in.

So my question is what happens when you don't want to kill yourself, but you can't deal with digging yourself out of this rock bottom state? Is there a place where they will put you where you don't have to leave your bed? Psych ward or something?  I want to be put away forever. I can't deal with the uphill battle I will have to face in life and my regrets and hopelessness is way too strong to battle anymore. I do not have any strength left to improve myself at all. I do not want to be released from the care of others. Where do they put someone like me at his point. Any advice?Where will I end up if I know I can't deal with life and don't want to kill myself."

,depression,"So i was at a party and got drunk, not i cant walk drunk, but drunk enough to make my metabolism fast enough to get rid of all the meds in my blood i guess. I just finished high school and at this party were all my classmates and the people i once called friends. 
I thought i could go there and talk to them and try to befriend them again. I miss them so much.

,depression,"Hi! I've been battling depression for the past two years, officially diagnosed in summer 2019, currently on medication &amp; therapy.

Anyways, after another horrifying therapy session of me complaining that i am really just a piece of shit that only wants to sleep 24/7, wasting her life away not accomplishing anything, my therapist urged me to list all the things which i do DO and sort of look at them from afar and try to practice gratitude and appreciation.

1) most days, I am able to make myself brush my teeth and on the good days even take a shower  
2) i could have given up on all work  to kind of ""sleep through"" my depression (my partner can support me financially with no trouble) however as tempting as it is I still do the work (working remotely from home) and recently took on a big project, which I was debating declining but still didn't (no idea how and if  im going to handle it but ill update you on here)  
3) roughly once a week I may feel like putting on makeup and doing my nails  
4) i am able to socialize with my best friend and truly enjoy our evenings together, which is a huge one  
5) i am now able to recognise that the meds do really help and I stopped having hysterical breakdowns and intrusive, disturbing thoughts  
6) i have never missed a day of therapy  
7) even though my sleep schedule is non-existence (sleeping every 4 hours during the course of a day) I still pull myself out of bed, have breakfast, maybe out on some clothes and go out to work in a cafe, even if for just an hour

They determined I was the quiet one and didn’t like to talk much but up until highschool I never had that problem, I felt like I got sunk into a depression and never really came out of it and now I’m stuck being profiled as this guy I’m not, even when I speak I get spoken over like it’s a primal thing or them trying to shun my words? 

I don’t want people to think my parents where bad they were great but I just don’t understand it at all. For me when I have kids I’d make sure to see the quiet signs 

Thanks for listeningMy parents always thought I was lazy"
,depression,"I have no one to listen to my problems so I thought I would write them down. Then I decided to post it on here. 

Just moved to a new city and started at a new school. I don't miss anything from my old hometown, I'm actually quite happy to be somewhere else. Moving has been tough though. I had to give up my cat and say goodbye to my friends.

I have kind of 'joined' a group of friends at school. They're all pretty nice. The dynamic of the group is a little weird though. Its like 50% introverts who don't talk much, myself included, and 50% strongly opinionated extroverts. They mostly seem like a nice group of people though. In regard to making friends, things have gone pretty well. Trying to form deep relationships with people is a hard and long process though. It's hard not to get impatient and blame myself though. I feel like I'm being ungrateful because even though I think I've been lucky in finding a group of friends, which is exactly what I want, I still feel so shit.

I've never been diagnosed but I think I could have depression and/or anxiety. I would love to get some medication if it would ease the pain, but I don't want to tell my parents how I feel.

Over the past few years I've thought of suicide probably at least once a month, usually weekly or daily though, and planned it two or three times in my life. I've been thinking about it a lot recently. I've been researching pills I can get at a chemist that I could overdose on and I've found a suicide bridge that's very close to my house. I've been told that I should live for all the good moments in life, but the effort it takes to reach those moments doesn't seem worth it sometimes.

I'm starting to find it hard to trust myself. I'm like a different person from day to day, or even hour to hour. During the brief moments when I feel happy about something I worry about my emotions causing me to do something I regret. When I'm sad or empty it's all I can think about.

There's this girl who's not in my new social circle but who has been really nice to me. She seems like a really nice person. We don't see each other much but she always makes an effort to greet me. I'm unsure whether her intentions are romantic or platonic and it's making me dizzy. I really want us to become better friends or maybe more, but I am not great at social interaction and always make myself feel shit about every little mistake I make. I feel kind of like It'll never happen, yet I spent the whole afternoon texting her. I feel like I'm going insane.

The people I admire most are the ones that seem like the nicest people you could ever know and make you feel happy just being present or after a short conversation and you're always left wanting more from them. I aspire to be like this and make other people happy. I need to remember to smile more though.

Usually I have a high libido but the past two weeks my drive has literally been non-existent. A month ago my shit suddenly became sloppy even though my diet is quite healthy and hasn't changed much, I think it is anxiety causing me to be extremely tense all the time. I just started waking up at 4am every morning out of nowhere and I can't stop. I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.

I feel so lonely. I just want someone to talk to and listen to. Getting to that point with someone new takes time and I'm getting kind of impatient.

I don't know what to do to make myself happy. If things worked out with this girl I think I would be happier, yet the thought of her losing interest in me makes me feel awful.

,depression,"Hi there to all witches who take their craft seriously and really work, I am very deperate and on the brink of killing myself, there is so much to life; this I know. Unfortunately for me every door, every option, every opertunity has been closed off for me since I was born. 
Before I say what I came here to ask here's alittle backstory...

Backstory - throughout my mom's pregnancy the doctors were absolutely sure I was to be born a healthy baby girl, but somewhere along the line something unexpected happened and I came out not only a boy (according to what I've been told and what's written on my birth certificate) I was also unfortunate enough to be born with cleft lip, cleft palette, asthma, droopy eyes(don't know if that's the clinical term, but basically up until I was 8 or 10 [can't remember] I was unable to open my eyes all the way), and various other problems. I have always felt like I should not have been born a boy let alone live past 3 weeks (another failed diagnosis, lucky me right?). 

My childhood consisted of doing stuff to get attention but really all I wanted was to be liked a very hard thing to do when you are basically physically retarded and cannot talk like everyone else and constantly being reminded how you are such a failer that you couldn't even be born right. Since my conciousness first made its way into this world I have found myself thinking as a girl, along with thinking how much better litterally my life would have been if I managed to get it right. My dad was never in the picture so growing up without a father has been difficult on its own, but of course I was informed my dad had the chance to come to America when I was born because of my condition, but he declined to start a new family and I'm sure he had other reasons. My mom always worked all the time so it was pretty much me and my older brother for some time. An older brother that constantly made fun of me along with my mom for how I talked and how I acted. My brother constantly calling me gay, faggot, bitch, you name it he's done it. I'm sure he was unaware of how I felt inside but it traumatized me so much I am afraid of being myself. My body is not shaped how normal guy's are either so I have no idea how to take that problem. At school o was labeled the retarded kid no one liked.

Once I turned 11 my mom met a man, let's call him D. D was/is military and I later found out they got married quick (span of a few months) to finance my surgeries because I came from a background of poverty being single parent with 2 kids (later 3). I was always treated like a pet and always had the harshest and most frequent punishments. I was always forced to do everything for everybody else. My brother had to go do something like talk to a neighbor to get the bike fixed, I had to do it, stuff like that. To this day I get asked by family to buy their plane tickets or order them stuff cause they ""don't know how"". I have always been used all my life. I am nothing but a tool. As I patiently waited for the surgeries that I was supposed to get (atleast just the one to fix my nose and make me look somewhat normal) when I was 12, then delayed to 16, then 18, and finally at 19. I received the first surgery and all they did was make my life a living hell. 

Medical history - The doctor messed up my nose and now theres a glasses size gap on the bridge of my nose, for the tip of it they put cartalage from my side [which they lied to me and took it out of under my right chest] is fat which I didn't even care about having in the first place I just wanted my nose to be straight and deal with the rest later. I was put in a maxillary distractor (fancy name for cage on my head). To move my upper jaw forward so that they can reconstruct the palate (roof of my mouth) and straighten jaw or whatever they were doing I have no clue and it seemed unnessesary to me. It did however improve my speech just a tiny bit. I had to wear this crap o. My head for 4 months. Later I then made my own appointments 2 years later (22) and got a surgery for bonegraft. I am still missing the tooth implant which I cannot afford nor will I ever be able to, and I have to have another surgery on my nose again. I have always suffered from depression because of this but not only because of my unfortunate medical circumstances. (Also I have been getting pains around my abdominal area so either I've got something going on down there that shouldn't be or when I was born the doctors decided it be best to stick a penis on me and call me a boy).

As for the other reasons why I'm highly depressed and on the verge of collapsing. I was forced by my stepdad to go into debt. I wanted to go to college but I wanted to do it like everyone else, a real place surrounded by real people so I can maybe make atleast one friend and not be a total failer. Of course my luck hits home again and he forced me to go to an online college with the promiss of letting me use the money the army provides to him for school use. I agree and then he turns and days ""yea no... Do it yourself"". Landing me 16k debt that I can't pay, 3k I was forced to pay (just to get my diploma) and 3k my mom was forced to pay for me to be able to enroll in classes. Before this though I was planning to join the military to get a one up on life, but apparently not God's plan. Since when I brought up the idea he straight refused. I was not allowed to work or go out, I did not have an allowance or any type of money except money I got for my birthday ($20 every year, ages 18-19-20) and it didn't help that I had no friends up until senior year in highschool (that summer is the only happy memories I have after leaving my home town. He was very controlling that's why I feel I can't do anything without the constant reminder of all the trauma I've faced.

I did however keep the promis I made to myself about joining the military. Unfortunately though I was not let in. After two years of waiting and providing all of the medical paperwork I was finally sent to MEPS for the Marines, finally a chance for me to straighten out my life and man up and get all these rediculous thoughts and feelings out my head. NOPE! Once I get there I take the ASVAP and score on the higher side (I know right smarts actually came in handy I might look like a retard but my mental capacity is on the higher side) scored 80. Go through medical everything good up until the physical, the doctor asks me if I always been tall and skinny (I have a very feminine body besides the lack of breasts and having a penis) I say yes, normal ok cool then I go to the eye exam and they tell me I have astigmatism in my left eye (this I knew it happened when I was about 5 or so, started hallucinating and seeing giant spiders with extream detail) I went to see if I can get this fixed they said and I quote ""the damage to your eye is so savire that we do not have the equipment required to even make a dent of progress, the best solution I can offer is to use the effected eye and hope it gets better over time, sorry but there is nothing we can do for you at this time."" - Lasik doctor. So dream job at Marines = no go. The MEPS people tell me to try the army cause they accept pretty much anyone. I do and same thing they say I can't join because of my stupid eye, gee thanks God. 

At this point I start thinking maybe it's not meant to be and give up. 

My job history is halarious, atleast to me. Almost even didn't get hired. First job at age 20, McDonald's. Mom gets a house with my brother who got to live my fantasy of being in the military and travel the world, who then decides to mock me and make my life even worse by deciding he needs a surgery on his penis (he thought it was so curved he can't have sex yet he never tried, now he's depressed and thinks he can never have it and the doctor messed up, doctor also gave him circomsition) this happened during my attempt at joining the Marines. Throughout the course of 6 months he would constantly scream at the top of his lungs and say how God hates him, this is punishment, lash out at me for no reason, and make me feel not only unsafe but want to take my own life even more just to get out of that situation. Once we move into the new house this continues along with me every day for months on end calming him down explaining and telling him to be patient cause it's not gunna heal right away and healing of the body depends on the mind state anyways. Because of the move I am forced to quit my job that I actually enjoyed, to transfer to another McDonald's on the side of town we moved to (two towns down) I work there for 6 months before quitting because of how unfairly I was being treated, everything was my fault, I never did anything right, I was lazy, the works (even though I did mainly everybody's job in the kitchen, everyday I washed the grill swept mopped multiple times a day, I would be on grill then on the table making the burgers, I'd go and get the 50 pound boxes from the freezer. You name it I did it.) I eventually quit after 6 months bought a one way ticket to California and said my goodbyes to my brother who called my mom crying saying I left and he tried to stop me... I was sick of his shit. I had shit I was dealing with all my life and now I have to deal with you and your problem too, (excuse the langauge but) fuck outta here with that shit. 
I have so little control over my own life that I only spent 2 days in California before my mom told the entire family where I was and got my aunt (grandma's sister so technically grandma, who's also a nun) to somehow convince me to go to New York and stay with my uncle. I can't believe I actually fell for their stupid guilt trip but somehow after only 5 days I was off to NYC. I told myself it's probably best since there are lots of opportunities for me to be a musican. Wrong. I was basically plummited into the same exact situation with different people. Greedy money hungry aunt, no jobs, no money, an uncle who works at night sleeps durring the day, wierd daughter that turned into her mother. I had to get outta there it got to the point where she was looking through my stuff while I wasn't there to find proof I could pay her $700 to stay in the shitty, stinky room they kept rabbits in. With a door that locks from the outside and a broken window, very small room at that. After two months of looking for jobs while making music simaltaniously I am being called a liar I good for nothing a lazy bum you name it that's what she labeled me. I manage to get a job at McDonald's again but in NY. I manage to set up the bonegraft appointment and lay on an air mattress for two weeks feeling useless and being called useless. I go back to work and then move into my grandpa's room he was renting. Lucky for me he was on vacation for the next two months. Durring this time when my granpa came back j felt obligated and wanted to help with his bills ultimately giving him what little I had. 4 months pass and after much consideration and mom/brother begging for me to come back I oblige. 
I then get a job at another McDonald's in the next town over oppisate direction with the help of my old boss. I work there for 6 months before quitting because of the same drama the first time and hearing people continuously talking shit about me making me feel terrible about myself even more and with the emense parinoia I was experiencing due to smoking too much (the parinoia was about how I hid the fact I'm not normal and that I wish to be a girl and intricate details of my life).

If you think that's it well your wrong... My aunt comes to the USA on a visa and is put in a shit situation feeling unsafe, according to her. My mom is the only one in the USA she knows, mom folds and buys her a plane ticket to stay here for the time being, money my mom didn't have, which is fine desperate times desperate measures and such. She stays here for an entire month and quickly realises there is nothing here, everything is far and you have to drive everywhere. The time that she was here I could have used to work on my music the 3 hours I was left alone in the house, but no. 
Everything that she bought or well made me buy she complains and says it's for someone else, complains she didn't buy anything for herself and how she had to use my mom's clothes cause instead of buy things for herself she bought for everyone else supposedly. She then says how she needs a phone and makes me go find one for her. After I go through the trouble of finding and iPhone 7 plus for a crazy deal ($150) which they usually go for 300-350 I go and I borrow money to go get her the phone. She then says oh... I wanted a more modern one....like yours.... I'm like ugh ok I reset mine give her it and she then says she will give me the 150 (my phone was iPhone X pristine condition). Months pass I still don't have a job (stopped looking to focus on getting my licence), everybody keeps making excuses not to teach me, and the piece of crap car that my brother was going to pass down to me needs a new battery so I can't use it, and he also decided to retract the offer before I got the chance to use it and is selling it because he doesn't want to pay for it. He is not rich but wealthy $40k in the bank meanwhile I'm 30k in debt 12 of which collectors are being sent now. 

Debt - borrowed money I didn't have to help pay bills to not be called worthless and useless. Borrowed too much then took 5k out and ran away to California

That brings me to the present day, some details have been left out as to not make this extreamly long.
(Side note: I have always liked girls but it's more like an admiration/envy type of thing, always wishing I was one cause I always felt just wrong in my own body)

Of course my luck hits home again and he forced me to go to an online college with the promiss of letting me use the money the army provides to him for school use. I agree and then he turns and days &amp;quot;yea no... Do it yourself&amp;quot;. Landing me 16k debt that I can&amp;#39;t pay, 3k I was forced to pay (just to get my diploma) and 3k my mom was forced to pay for me to be able to enroll in classes. Before this though I was planning to join the military to get a one up on life, but apparently not God&amp;#39;s plan. Since when I brought up the idea he straight refused. I was not allowed to work or go out, I did not have an allowance or any type of money except money I got for my birthday ($20 every year, ages 18-19-20) and it didn&amp;#39;t help that I had no friends up until senior year in highschool (that summer is the only happy memories I have after leaving my home town. He was very controlling that&amp;#39;s why I feel I can&amp;#39;t do anything without the constant reminder of all the trauma I&amp;#39;ve faced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did however keep the promis I made to myself about joining the military. Unfortunately though I was not let in. After two years of waiting and providing all of the medical paperwork I was finally sent to MEPS for the Marines, finally a chance for me to straighten out my life and man up and get all these rediculous thoughts and feelings out my head. NOPE! Once I get there I take the ASVAP and score on the higher side (I know right smarts actually came in handy I might look like a retard but my mental capacity is on the higher side) scored 80. Go through medical everything good up until the physical, the doctor asks me if I always been tall and skinny (I have a very feminine body besides the lack of breasts and having a penis) I say yes, normal ok cool then I go to the eye exam and they tell me I have astigmatism in my left eye (this I knew it happened when I was about 5 or so, started hallucinating and seeing giant spiders with extream detail) I went to see if I can get this fixed they said and I quote &amp;quot;the damage to your eye is so savire that we do not have the equipment required to even make a dent of progress, the best solution I can offer is to use the effected eye and hope it gets better over time, sorry but there is nothing we can do for you at this time.&amp;quot; - Lasik doctor. So dream job at Marines = no go. The MEPS people tell me to try the army cause they accept pretty much anyone. I do and same thing they say I can&amp;#39;t join because of my stupid eye, gee thanks God. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I start thinking maybe it&amp;#39;s not meant to be and give up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job history is halarious, atleast to me. Almost even didn&amp;#39;t get hired. First job at age 20, McDonald&amp;#39;s. Mom gets a house with my brother who got to live my fantasy of being in the military and travel the world, who then decides to mock me and make my life even worse by deciding he needs a surgery on his penis (he thought it was so curved he can&amp;#39;t have sex yet he never tried, now he&amp;#39;s depressed and thinks he can never have it and the doctor messed up, doctor also gave him circomsition) this happened during my attempt at joining the Marines. Throughout the course of 6 months he would constantly scream at the top of his lungs and say how God hates him, this is punishment, lash out at me for no reason, and make me feel not only unsafe but want to take my own life even more just to get out of that situation. Once we move into the new house this continues along with me every day for months on end calming him down explaining and telling him to be patient cause it&amp;#39;s not gunna heal right away and healing of the body depends on the mind state anyways. Because of the move I am forced to quit my job that I actually enjoyed, to transfer to another McDonald&amp;#39;s on the side of town we moved to (two towns down) I work there for 6 months before quitting because of how unfairly I was being treated, everything was my fault, I never did anything right, I was lazy, the works (even though I did mainly everybody&amp;#39;s job in the kitchen, everyday I washed the grill swept mopped multiple times a day, I would be on grill then on the table making the burgers, I&amp;#39;d go and get the 50 pound boxes from the freezer. You name it I did it.) I eventually quit after 6 months bought a one way ticket to California and said my goodbyes to my brother who called my mom crying saying I left and he tried to stop me... I was sick of his shit. I had shit I was dealing with all my life and now I have to deal with you and your problem too, (excuse the langauge but) fuck outta here with that shit. 
I have so little control over my own life that I only spent 2 days in California before my mom told the entire family where I was and got my aunt (grandma&amp;#39;s sister so technically grandma, who&amp;#39;s also a nun) to somehow convince me to go to New York and stay with my uncle. I can&amp;#39;t believe I actually fell for their stupid guilt trip but somehow after only 5 days I was off to NYC. I told myself it&amp;#39;s probably best since there are lots of opportunities for me to be a musican. Wrong. I was basically plummited into the same exact situation with different people. Greedy money hungry aunt, no jobs, no money, an uncle who works at night sleeps durring the day, wierd daughter that turned into her mother. I had to get outta there it got to the point where she was looking through my stuff while I wasn&amp;#39;t there to find proof I could pay her $700 to stay in the shitty, stinky room they kept rabbits in. With a door that locks from the outside and a broken window, very small room at that. After two months of looking for jobs while making music simaltaniously I am being called a liar I good for nothing a lazy bum you name it that&amp;#39;s what she labeled me. I manage to get a job at McDonald&amp;#39;s again but in NY. I manage to set up the bonegraft appointment and lay on an air mattress for two weeks feeling useless and being called useless. I go back to work and then move into my grandpa&amp;#39;s room he was renting. Lucky for me he was on vacation for the next two months. Durring this time when my granpa came back j felt obligated and wanted to help with his bills ultimately giving him what little I had. 4 months pass and after much consideration and mom/brother begging for me to come back I oblige. 
I then get a job at another McDonald&amp;#39;s in the next town over oppisate direction with the help of my old boss. I work there for 6 months before quitting because of the same drama the first time and hearing people continuously talking shit about me making me feel terrible about myself even more and with the emense parinoia I was experiencing due to smoking too much (the parinoia was about how I hid the fact I&amp;#39;m not normal and that I wish to be a girl and intricate details of my life).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think that&amp;#39;s it well your wrong... My aunt comes to the USA on a visa and is put in a shit situation feeling unsafe, according to her. My mom is the only one in the USA she knows, mom folds and buys her a plane ticket to stay here for the time being, money my mom didn&amp;#39;t have, which is fine desperate times desperate measures and such. She stays here for an entire month and quickly realises there is nothing here, everything is far and you have to drive everywhere. The time that she was here I could have used to work on my music the 3 hours I was left alone in the house, but no. 
Everything that she bought or well made me buy she complains and says it&amp;#39;s for someone else, complains she didn&amp;#39;t buy anything for herself and how she had to use my mom&amp;#39;s clothes cause instead of buy things for herself she bought for everyone else supposedly. She then says how she needs a phone and makes me go find one for her. After I go through the trouble of finding and iPhone 7 plus for a crazy deal ($150) which they usually go for 300-350 I go and I borrow money to go get her the phone. She then says oh... I wanted a more modern one....like yours.... I&amp;#39;m like ugh ok I reset mine give her it and she then says she will give me the 150 (my phone was iPhone X pristine condition). Months pass I still don&amp;#39;t have a job (stopped looking to focus on getting my licence), everybody keeps making excuses not to teach me, and the piece of crap car that my brother was going to pass down to me needs a new battery so I can&amp;#39;t use it, and he also decided to retract the offer before I got the chance to use it and is selling it because he doesn&amp;#39;t want to pay for it. He is not rich but wealthy $40k in the bank meanwhile I&amp;#39;m 30k in debt 12 of which collectors are being sent now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt - borrowed money I didn&amp;#39;t have to help pay bills to not be called worthless and useless. Borrowed too much then took 5k out and ran away to California&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings me to the present day, some details have been left out as to not make this extreamly long.
(Side note: I have always liked girls but it&amp;#39;s more like an admiration/envy type of thing, always wishing I was one cause I always felt just wrong in my own body)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok TL;DR shit life should have been born a girl, instead I came out with so many problems and mental issues along with the traumatizing circumstances I was put in and the problems still continue.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately for me every door, every option, every opertunity has been closed off for me since I was born. 
Before I say what I came here to ask here's alittle backstory...

Backstory - throughout my mom's pregnancy the doctors were absolutely sure I was to be born a healthy baby girl, but somewhere along the line something unexpected happened and I came out not only a boy (according to what I've been told and what's written on my birth certificate) I was also unfortunate enough to be born with cleft lip, cleft palette, asthma, droopy eyes(don't know if that's the clinical term, but basically up until I was 8 or 10 [can't remember] I was unable to open my eyes all the way), and various other problems. I have always felt like I should not have been born a boy let alone live past 3 weeks (another failed diagnosis, lucky me right?). 

My childhood consisted of doing stuff to get attention but really all I wanted was to be liked a very hard thing to do when you are basically physically retarded and cannot talk like everyone else and constantly being reminded how you are such a failer that you couldn't even be born right. Since my conciousness first made its way into this world I have found myself thinking as a girl, along with thinking how much better litterally my life would have been if I managed to get it right. My dad was never in the picture so growing up without a father has been difficult on its own, but of course I was informed my dad had the chance to come to America when I was born because of my condition, but he declined to start a new family and I'm sure he had other reasons. My mom always worked all the time so it was pretty much me and my older brother for some time. An older brother that constantly made fun of me along with my mom for how I talked and how I acted. My brother constantly calling me gay, faggot, bitch, you name it he's done it. I'm sure he was unaware of how I felt inside but it traumatized me so much I am afraid of being myself. My body is not shaped how normal guy's are either so I have no idea how to take that problem. At school o was labeled the retarded kid no one liked.

Once I turned 11 my mom met a man, let's call him D. D was/is military and I later found out they got married quick (span of a few months) to finance my surgeries because I came from a background of poverty being single parent with 2 kids (later 3). I was always treated like a pet and always had the harshest and most frequent punishments. I was always forced to do everything for everybody else. My brother had to go do something like talk to a neighbor to get the bike fixed, I had to do it, stuff like that. To this day I get asked by family to buy their plane tickets or order them stuff cause they ""don't know how"". I have always been used all my life. I am nothing but a tool. As I patiently waited for the surgeries that I was supposed to get (atleast just the one to fix my nose and make me look somewhat normal) when I was 12, then delayed to 16, then 18, and finally at 19. I received the first surgery and all they did was make my life a living hell. 

Medical history - The doctor messed up my nose and now theres a glasses size gap on the bridge of my nose, for the tip of it they put cartalage from my side [which they lied to me and took it out of under my right chest] is fat which I didn't even care about having in the first place I just wanted my nose to be straight and deal with the rest later. I was put in a maxillary distractor (fancy name for cage on my head). To move my upper jaw forward so that they can reconstruct the palate (roof of my mouth) and straighten jaw or whatever they were doing I have no clue and it seemed unnessesary to me. It did however improve my speech just a tiny bit. I had to wear this crap o. My head for 4 months. Later I then made my own appointments 2 years later (22) and got a surgery for bonegraft. I am still missing the tooth implant which I cannot afford nor will I ever be able to, and I have to have another surgery on my nose again. I have always suffered from depression because of this but not only because of my unfortunate medical circumstances. (Also I have been getting pains around my abdominal area so either I've got something going on down there that shouldn't be or when I was born the doctors decided it be best to stick a penis on me and call me a boy).

As for the other reasons why I'm highly depressed and on the verge of collapsing. I was forced by my stepdad to go into debt. I wanted to go to college but I wanted to do it like everyone else, a real place surrounded by real people so I can maybe make atleast one friend and not be a total failer. Of course my luck hits home again and he forced me to go to an online college with the promiss of letting me use the money the army provides to him for school use. I agree and then he turns and days ""yea no... Do it yourself"". Landing me 16k debt that I can't pay, 3k I was forced to pay (just to get my diploma) and 3k my mom was forced to pay for me to be able to enroll in classes. Before this though I was planning to join the military to get a one up on life, but apparently not God's plan. Since when I brought up the idea he straight refused. I was not allowed to work or go out, I did not have an allowance or any type of money except money I got for my birthday ($20 every year, ages 18-19-20) and it didn't help that I had no friends up until senior year in highschool (that summer is the only happy memories I have after leaving my home town. He was very controlling that's why I feel I can't do anything without the constant reminder of all the trauma I've faced.

I did however keep the promis I made to myself about joining the military. Unfortunately though I was not let in. After two years of waiting and providing all of the medical paperwork I was finally sent to MEPS for the Marines, finally a chance for me to straighten out my life and man up and get all these rediculous thoughts and feelings out my head.

My best friends have given up on me, they tell me fuck off cause they don’t want to be around me. My parents have given up, I told them I wanted to go to therapy when I was 13 and they told me it was a waste of time. I don’t feel emotions, I haven’t felt happy/sad in about a year.

I've been an artist my whole life, ever since I can remember. I went through many years of art school, and while studying I was doing well. Art has been synonymous with my identity forever, and I've always wanted to be an artist more than anything else.

But I've also had mental health issues my entire life, and I've gone through a couple of periods of terrible depression in the past. I've been medicated since I was a child, so that's helped most of the time. But now, starting last autumn, I've gone into a depressive period that's a bit different than the previous ones. 

I think a combination of my medication losing efficacy and experiencing an artistic burnout are the reasons for this depression. I did two solo shows recently and have been pushing myself to draw so much, so I think burnout is very likely. In any case, I started to notice that I didn't enjoy drawing anymore.

Drawing became a terrible, dreaded chore. It started to feel like way too much work - and that work was not interesting or exciting. The work was also difficult and just SO much. SO many lines. Honestly, when I think about drawing I start to feel physically unwell. 

I've been advised to take a break from drawing, and I'm doing so. I haven't actually drawn anything for about a couple of weeks, and I'm going for one month. 

I'm just so terrified that I'll never enjoy drawing again. I can't even remember what it feels like to not hate drawing. But I still want to be an artist so much. Plus, I honestly don't have any other hobbies unrelated to art that I could focus on. Nothing else really interests me.

I should also mention that I'm switching medications right now, and I'm about to go onto a full dose of my new medication (which is actually one that's worked for me in the past).

,depression,"Over the past few months, my depression and social anxiety have spiraled out of control. At the end of my junior year of high school I had a really bad breakup and lost all my friends causing me to start self harming and isolating myself from everyone. Thankfully, this acquaintance I had took time out of his day to make music with me at lunch. It really meant a lot to me. He was the only friend I really had at the time. I had hung out with his friends a couple times before throughout high school, so I started playing video games with some of them. Eventually during the summer I got really close to them, and I became a part of their friend group. They really brought me out of that dark hole of depression, and I had never loved a group of friends more in my entire life. I had and still am going through extreme social anxiety, but helped me become more confident in myself and alleviated that a bunch. In the beginning of senior year I hung out with them after-school basically everyday, and it was the happiest I’d ever been. 

I don’t want to get into details but then something changed. A bunch of the group dynamics changed that made me felt inferior. I thought they thought I wasn’t as funny anymore, and was more weird and awkward. I reverted back to the state I was in with my previous girlfriend, and I started to worry incessantly that I would be abandoned by them. My mindset about the group also changed. I felt like I had to constantly meet their standards and entertain them or else they would abandon me. This has made socializing with them more of a grueling chore than a fun experience. I’ve isolated myself from them a lot, and I even feel a bit of anger towards them. 

There are these events that happen that make me feel like they think I’m weird, awkward, unfunny, and annoying, so I constantly try to change myself.

,depression,"No longer have any passion for my interests, or even any passion for life tbh. Im lonely af, feel worthless and hopeless. I dont want to kill myself though my mind tells me i do. But id much rather be happy, thrive and prosper. Its strange for sure. I'd like to say im a hard worker, im intuitive and a problem solver. There's things i aspire to do, and know im phyiscally and mentally capable of doing in one part of my mind.

As the title suggests, where to go or how to help yourself where my options are severely limited?
My GP can only organise pills for me. I have no way of acquiring a therapist. I have been severely depressed for past couple of weeks and mildly since about November.

I don't have a trusted parent, sibling or a friend that I could open up to. I tried a while ago but I ask to support me in functioning day to day, pushing me to work and they just tell me they're sorry or they wish they could help. You know, the empty ""You can talk to me, it will get better"". Then they cut contact. My boyfriend just says he doesn't know how to help me and has phases of randomly complimenting me or texting me to tell me he loves me for two days straight then he forgets all about it. I'm sure he tries his best but I just wish I had more support and he says ""he can't help me anymore than he does"" everytime. I feel so trapped. I always have to pretend I'm fine. I always cover up with humor. It seems like I'm insincere or dramatic when I finally snap and just say I'm a mess. 

I can't afford a therapist. My university counselling office won't help me. They offered a suicide hotline numbers (?) and  ""we're sorry but this isn't a psychological support that we do here"".

My parents had me 11 years into their marriage and I have no siblings. 

I was homeschooled for most of my childhood and super sheltered from everything in life. Never allowed to have sleepovers, rarely allowed to have friends over, had every moment of my life scheduled and micromanaged.  I was never encouraged to pursue anything except becoming a professional soccer player (which was never what I wanted to do, but something my dad wanted me to do as a way to live out his dreams through me vicariously.) 

He was never around. He financially supported me and my mom and lived in the same city as us most of the time, but was never there to parent me and was rarely even around on holidays or birthdays. He kept his things at our house, but came home maybe once a month, sometimes less. He always said he needed to be closer to work so he was staying at his friend’s house (everything in the whole city is a 30 minute drive or less, and he never worked for anyone but himself.) 

Now that I’m an adult, I understand he was living with various girlfriends though he was still married to my mom, and she always seemed to be waiting up for him to come home and finally be a dad/husband. 

I developed severe anorexia at 12, and my family seemed to ignore it even though I stopped growing, lost 40 pounds, was rarely eating, and was exercising 4-6 hours a day. When I was literally weeks away from death with a BMI of &lt;12, my mom finally took me to a doctor after my grandma begged her to because “something was really wrong with me.” The doctor told her I was  anorexic and recommended in-patient treatment and psychotherapy. My mom yelled at the doctor, said “there’s no way MY daughter is anorexic,” and stormed out of the office. 

For the next 6 months or so, I stayed at the same weight and, nightly, would sit down at the dinner table with my mom and cry for hours while she screamed at me to finish my food. I never went to therapy for the eating disorder and she denied every doctor who told her I was mentally ill. She was SURE I had tapeworms, a thyroid disease, celiac, or some other ailment that had caused me to lose 40% of my body weight. I stayed at a dangerously low weight until I was 16, which is the first year I went to school, and traded my ED for nightly sneaking out, binge drinking, and bulimia. 

When I was 16, I was almost arrested for trying to buy alcohol, and my dad found out and told me if I wanted alcohol I could just ask him. He started helping me sneak out and giving me alcohol whenever I wanted. I think he did this to drive a wedge between my mom and me, he always loved to have secrets that we would keep from her. He would take me around his 23 year old girlfriend and tell me to not tell my mom. In fact, he would blackmail me, saying things like “don’t tell mom about so and so, you would hate for her to find out about you sneaking out and partying right?” 

When I was 17, my dad lost all his businesses and wealth, and has still been unable to recover from the financial loss. He pinned all his happiness on money, and once it was gone he changed completely. Every time I’ve talked to him since then, all he’s talked about is how broke he is and how my mom caused his financial ruin and what a stupid idiot she is. He curses my mom around me almost every time he talks to me.

He had a long talk with me one night when I was 16. He told me that I should never have kids because they’ll ruin my life. He never wanted kids. He would be a multi millionaire and so happy and free if he had never had a family. My mom is a crazy lunatic and has only ruined his life and finances. 

I fell into a horribly abusive, 4 year relationship with a guy when I was 17. I bounced around from college to vocational school, and also had a moderately successful entertainment career. I’ve never been able to find footing anywhere. I feel like I can’t connect with anyone. I really don’t feel passion for anything and don’t feel like there’s any path in life that I want to take, though I do feel like I’m talented in multiple things. I’m awful at romantic relationships and friendships (maybe because I never had a healthy relationship example from my family, and never had long term friendships when I was growing up?) 

About a year ago, I was talking with my dad about how I wanted to get a job that made a lot of money like bottle service. He suggested I become a stripper. And so I did. I danced for a year, and he insisted I call him and tell him how much money I made every night, and he acted like I was so lucky because he “gave me permission” to do this. Like wtf I’m a grown adult who’s been living on my own since 18, and god knows I was putting in the work all on my own for all the money I made. 

Every time I see him he’s so negative and toxic and I realize now that a lot of the anxiety and problems I felt as a child (I’ve been suicidal literally since I can remember) stemmed from the insane toxic energy that always engulfed my family life. 

I’ve done a lot of psychedelics, and I really do have a good grip on spirituality and mindfulness, and know there’s something way bigger than this earth plane we live on. There are light forces and dark forces. The thing is, lately, I just don’t feel like I am meant to be blessed by the light forces. Like I was born out of darkness from a cursed family, and I am doomed to be miserable, depressed, and toxic just like my dad. He is not a good person. I think he’s a narcissistic sociopath and it scares me that half of my genes come from that. 

His dad was a total narcissist, no respect for women, I felt unexplainably awful vibes from him always. My paternal grandfather had a very successful business when he was younger, but somehow that all dissolved and he ended up completely broke with nothing to leave to his family, dementia, and a mindset that his children should take care of him (which they did, until his death last year.) My aunt put herself through unspeakable stress and pain to take care of my grandfather, who was completely ungrateful for it. 

Most of my dad’s family has ended up in a mental hospital by 70, and they’re all completely depressed or mentally ill, and I feel the same demons taking me under every day. I’ve felt dark forces around me since I can remember. I’ve seen my demons during nightmares and sleep paralysis. I think my abusive ex-boyfriend was influenced by the demons that follow me around. 

I can’t see anything good happening in my life long term. I fear I’m going to end up like everyone on my dad’s side. I recently talked about a lot of this stuff with my mom and she started crying and said she’s failed me in every way, she should’ve left my dad when I was little, and she wishes she never even married him because she was a teenager and literally only knew him for a few months before they got married. That hit so hard, because it just made me feel like my whole life was never even supposed to happen. I was just part of one giant fucked up mistake made by a naive 18 year old. 

I feel like I’m a lost soul, I wasn’t meant to exist, and because of that the dark energy got ahold of me. 

I don’t want to talk to my dad anymore. Am I wrong? I am questioning everything and I really hope I don’t live that long because I don’t see anyone in that family having any glimmer of a nice life over age 55. 

No one takes me seriously when I say my childhood fucked me up so much, because I grew up with a lot of material possessions, money, and a seemingly super involved mother. When people think of bad childhoods, they think of poverty, physical abuse, druggie parents, things like that. Maybe I’m a spoiled brat.

,depression,"I am 25, bilingual, gay(not ugly and above average looking and fit), Asian, nerdy(lived through most of my life being making fun or hated for my eccentricity)

I have no friends, but many acquaintances.(maybe I am putting friends to a very high standard)

I never had any relationship even though I came out 7 years ago to my parents, and being very open about my sexuality.
(I don’t want to share my body to strangers, so I reject all hook up attempts, and I feel that most gay people I met are just insecure, aimless and superficial) 

I am not shy, and I am eloquent and talkative in front of people. I can easily manage social scenes, but I don’t actually care how others think about me.

I was diagnosed with depression since high school for 4 years. I quit the medication few years ago because they are influencing my intelligence(seriously, I am going to work in software development, and I would rather feel shit but have a functioning brain than living in an illusion of relief and happiness caused by drug)


I born from a very conservative family in one of the East Asian countries. I hate my country and escape to US to study and hope to settle here. I have been here 7 years. Now I am getting a master degree in US, and I will be interning at one of the prestigious software company in this summer. (Now, I realize that my hatred to my mother nation is pointless, my suffering is purely due to my unfitness to this world, and nothing to do with policy and culture)

I struggled through the hardest part of my depression by following these tips below.

1.keep a routine and stick to it, no matter how tire how shit you feel. a to-do list such as “I will wash clothes today at xxxx” will help

2.abandon social network, they are toxic to your mental state. I only use it to share information rather than show-off my fake good life or see anyone’s fake good life.

3. Leave toxic people, and YES, most people are toxic to you especially if you are eccentric person. And give up on people, give up on hoping someone will magically show up and fix all your problems. 

4. A healthy life style is very important to keep you energy level up. Eat good, sleep good, be active.


5. Search on some higher purpose of life. I give up finding any happiness from human connection. I never felt love from a man before, never in a relationship, disappoint by people again again and again. Then I stick my interests to machine, I study computer science and I am fascinated by technology. I develop a religious zealous of what a future world I want to create or envisioned: i want to create something amazing, something redefining current human social structure. A world where outcast like me can feel happy and comfortable to live in. A world without crowd stupidity and adheres to the mercy of humanity, a world without division, bullying and misunderstanding.  That’s why my major focus of my computer science degree is artificial intelligence, go figure. The current state of humanity is pathetic, and that is why there are so many depression on this earth.


7.  Then, accept that it’s ok to never feel happy again. But the key to manage a life is not being always happy. I feel that I am more and more in the middle ground: not happy not sad, but just nothing. In these years since I was diagnosed with depression, I find out a single truth. 

Depression can never be gone and it can only be managed.

I gradually accept the fact that I am just a machine,(human body is in fact, just a machine)and I won’t feel the same happiness when I experience the same events like normal people do.  I will feel nothing, but sometime I feel that these kinds of nothingness is a form of tranquility. As long as I am not in constant pain and agony, I am fine with my current state. When people hurt me, I don’t care. When people benefits me, I don’t care. People are too predictable for me, and they are not important anymore. (The only exception is my parents because I feel sorry for them to suffer me)


However, after I live with these mindset for years, I gradually observe that not all people are asshole in nature. Not all people are ignorant. I will feel delighted to see when some people act differently from my calculation. (Someone who are supposed to hurt me, do not act upon, or someone who are supposed to benefits me, do not act upon)

Maybe as a person with depression, I can never experiences the joy of “living” with in this world.
But it doesn’t stop you to “live” out of this world, just treat it as a long boring trip on a train with randomly popping in objects of interests.

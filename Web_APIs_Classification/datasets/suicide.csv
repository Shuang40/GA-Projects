###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement"

,SuicideWatch,"I'm a 22 year old guy with my whole life ahead of me. I have a really great circle of friends who I feel completely accepted by, even with all my faults. I've got a dad and a step-mum who really love me and poured their heart and soul into trying to give me the best childhood they could. My actual mum is a useless piece of shit, but even she tried to do the best she could. Overall, I would consider myself to be  a loved person.

I'm on antidepressants, but I'm not even sure if they're working anymore. All my writing has taken a darker turn over the last month. I keep toying with the idea of killing myself. Often I lie curled up on my bed, reliving old memories and whispering ""I hate myself"" over and over again. The only music I want to listen to is depressing and sad. I can't even keep in the way I'm feeling when I'm around my friends anymore. They all know I want to die, I've been talking about it for months now. Part of me feels like talking about suicide gives it power. As if now I have to do it otherwise I'm a pussy.

I'm autistic and that's a big cause of a lot of my pain and misery. Deep down I just want to be accepted by wider society. But I always stick out wherever I go like a sore thumb. It's a tiny bit of a blessing but mostly it's a huge burden. I have always had so much trouble relating to people and have wasted so much time trying to learn how to fit in and socialise. I'm at a point now where I think I've succeeded in learning most of what I need to know to be able to form friendships, etc. But it has also made me painfully self-aware. I miss being oblivious to everything, now I scrutinise every minute detail of my behaviour and it feels like I'm constantly reliving old mistakes that I've made and it fills me with anxiety and regret.

I've only ever had two girlfriends so far. I imagine I must have some kind of internalised issues with women, because I seem to scare them off. I've been told that I get weird around girls. I don't know what to do about this, but it breaks my heart realising that dying alone is a very likely possibility at this rate. My only real goal in life is to one day start a family and to be a great dad. But knowing the way that I am, I doubt that I'd make a very good parent anyway. Better to die now and break the cycle.

I really love getting high. Especially from psychedelics. I've probably fried my brain from all the acid and shrooms I've done. I've done some harder drugs, mainly a shit load of MDMA, a tiny bit of cocaine (too expensive where I live to make a habit out of it fortunately), but never any meth or heroin, etc. I smoke a lot of weed even though it makes me really paranoid. I drink sometimes, but try and keep it to a minimum because I don't want to end up like my mum. I wish I could be high on acid all the time, it's the only time I feel normal.

Just as things were getting brighter for him. He had been struggling for years with drugs, alcohol and addiction in general. His dream was to get into his favourite guitar scool, two days after he died he got in. He had a psychologist appointment 1 day aftet his death. As he was getting better, he gave up. He was the kindest person alive, everyone agrees. He used all of his energy to help others, and  he didnt have enough energy to help himself. After a difficult peroid in his life after many struggles, he decided it would be best for him to end his eternal suffering on this earth. All of his friends and family saw a new light in him, and we thought it was going to work out for our favourite boy. 8th of march 2019 he took his life with an intentional heroin overdose, my family took it tough. Pressure, lack of communication, lonleyness and bad thoughts led him to his death. He said in his note that no one had done him any harm, he couldnt stand the world anymore.

,SuicideWatch,"cw: possible sexual assault





I’ve posted in here before, and I don’t really know why I am posting again.
I have been struggling with a specific situation for the past three years that is driving me mad. I want to kill myself, because I feel like an absolute monster and I feel like there is no other option. There is no redemption. No one would care if I killed myself, because it’s what I ultimately deserve. 
I had been talking to this guy on Tinder for a few months, and one evening we were Snapchatting and he said he went home from an event since he had an allergic reaction to wine. I asked if he was OK, and if he wanted me to bring him over some snacks because he also mentioned he had barely eaten. He said if I wanted to I could, so I did. I got to his apartment, and we sat on his bed and talked for about 45 minutes. He was on one side, and I was on the other. At one point, he told me I could come to his side of the bed, so I did. We started to make out, and I ultimately ended up fooling around with him.
Fast forward a few days later, I hadn’t heard much from him. I asked him if something was wrong after a few Snaps and getting no response, and he responded with that he felt very uncomfortable because he was drunk when we fooled around. He alluded to being taken advantage of, and although he never explicitly said the words “assault,” that was all I could think of. I profusely apologized and made it a point that I was apologizing directly to him for any harm that I caused. I even offered to report the situation if I wanted to. He responded that I was looking too much into the situation, and that “our time was just simply over.”
Ever since then, I haven’t been the same. I feel like a monster. Everything I ever wanted to do with my life I refuse to do, because it would give me a platform. I would hate for him to possibly see me performing music or owning my own company one day and triggering him. Every ounce of happiness I see someone have I know I’ll never be able to have. I don’t deserve it.
I have spent the past three years trying to validate myself, but I am awful for doing it. He could be traumatized from this, and thinking about myself and thinking about recovery from this is selfish. I try to look at the facts: I knew he had a drink, but I didn’t know he had enough to not consent. He didn’t seem drunk when we were taking, he seemed very level-headed and we were having a normal conversation. he never said to stop when we were fooling around. He was the one who initiated it. When I try to look at things, these are all things predators and racists say. It doesn’t matter, this is all my fault and I feel so awful. The guilt is eating me alive. I just want to know that he’s OK, but I cannot contact him with the fear that it will set him off. I just want to fucking end it all - I think it is the only option to set me free from this pain. He won’t have to worry about me anymore, even if he is. I know he said I was looking too much into it, but it takes people years to process stuff like this. I have no future ahead, and I want this all to be over.

I’m sorry. I don’t think I can get past my situation anymore. It’s been pretty rough. Me being abandoned by my only family sucks. I’ve tried. I don’t even know why I became the person I am today. Or maybe I do, I don’t know. 

To my mother whom I know did her best to give her support for me, sorry for letting you down. I’ve been such a good daughter before, why did I become so useless? You even thought about marrying another man because you can’t expect anything from a useless kid when I grow up, right? I’m sorry. I apologise for all those things I’ve done to you. Your sacrifices are going to be as useless as I am. I thought about buying you a house and a car when I grow up but I don’t think that’s going to happen anymore. It has been rough for you because of me. I’m so sorry. You’ll be free of burden soon. When I’m gone, I hope you’ll be happy. And not blame yourself or anyone. I chose this, I chose to end my pain. Will there be a heaven for me? I don’t know. And if I’ll know, I don’t think I can tell you the answer. Take care of yourself. It has only been 19 years since I was born. Who would’ve thought that I’ll meet my father in hell (or heaven) before you? No one.

To my friends, I’m so sorry for shutting you out. I have been depressed. I know I am. This is not sadness anymore. I can no longer endure the pain I’ve been going through. I’ve felt empty because no one was there to comfort me all this time. I have been to reddit to look at memes because I want to feel something. But it’s not working. I’m so sorry for letting you down. I thought I’m going to spend my future with you, laughing at ourselves because of our husbands and our kids. We had such great memories especially to my bestfriend Kaye Cee, who was there for me when my grades where failing and when I’m being laughed at at school. I appreciate all those efforts you gave when you told our classmates to stfu when they laughed at me. I appreciate when you told me that I can sleep over at your place so you can help me with my requirements. You’re such a nice friend. I’m sorry I can’t give your kindness back to you. I can still remember those times that we went to the carnival to buy some chicks and ride the carousel and everything. It was fun. I’m grateful to all the memories you gave me. You made my life worth living at least for a moment.

To my prof, sorry for having an incomplete and not being able to complete it. I will try harder next time if there is indeed reincarnation. Thank you for being kind to me and giving me a second chance. Sorry for wasting it though.

For my uncles, I am now forgiving you for sexually assaulting me. 

Thank you.

I’m sorry. I don’t think I can get past my situation anymore. It’s been pretty rough. Me being abandoned by my only family sucks. I’ve tried. I don’t even know why I became the person I am today. Or maybe I do, I don’t know. 

To my mother whom I know did her best to give her support for me, sorry for letting you down. I’ve been such a good daughter before, why did I become so useless? You even thought about marrying another man because you can’t expect anything from a useless kid when I grow up, right? I’m sorry. I apologise for all those things I’ve done to you. Your sacrifices are going to be as useless as I am. I thought about buying you a house and a car when I grow up but I don’t think that’s going to happen anymore. It has been rough for you because of me. I’m so sorry. You’ll be free of burden soon. When I’m gone, I hope you’ll be happy. And not blame yourself or anyone. I chose this, I chose to end my pain. Will there be a heaven for me? I don’t know. And if I’ll know, I don’t think I can tell you the answer. Take care of yourself. It has only been 19 years since I was born. Who would’ve thought that I’ll meet my father in hell (or heaven) before you? No one.

To my friends, I’m so sorry for shutting you out. I have been depressed. I know I am. This is not sadness anymore. I can no longer endure the pain I’ve been going through. I’ve felt empty because no one was there to comfort me all this time. I have been to reddit to look at memes because I want to feel something. But it’s not working. I’m so sorry for letting you down. I thought I’m going to spend my future with you, laughing at ourselves because of our husbands and our kids. We had such great memories especially to my bestfriend Kaye Cee, who was there for me when my grades where failing and when I’m being laughed at at school. I appreciate all those efforts you gave when you told our classmates to stfu when they laughed at me. I appreciate when you told me that I can sleep over at your place so you can help me with my requirements. You’re such a nice friend. I’m sorry I can’t give your kindness back to you. I can still remember those times that we went to the carnival to buy some chicks and ride the carousel and everything. It was fun. I’m grateful to all the memories you gave me. You made my life worth living at least for a moment.

To my prof, sorry for having an incomplete and not being able to complete it. I will try harder next time if there is indeed reincarnation. Thank you for being kind to me and giving me a second chance. Sorry for wasting it though.

For my uncles, I am now forgiving you for sexually assaulting me. 

Thank you.

Good bye. 

I hope my ukulele and guitar will not be thrown away. They were there for me in my darkest times.Suicide is all I can think about. And maybe this is a suicide letter, idk."

,SuicideWatch,"I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can't lose weight no matter how hard I try.   I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. 

I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. 

I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.

I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but been unable to. 

Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.

I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. 

I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. 

I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars then needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. 

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later..

I just literally can't take anymore of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum.

,SuicideWatch,"I think I'm done reaching out. I have a very close and supportive friend group, and I finally got out of my depressive loop. I was doing really well in my college courses, had genuine hope for my future career and life. Even handled breakup where I was cheated on like a champ, so that was great.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, coming out of winter break, one of my best friends (a guy, James) breaks up with one of my other best friends (a girl, Kayla). I've been trying to become the sort of person that everyone can be sure will be there for them when they need it. Kayla, is far more closed off and had no one to talk to about all this. So I tried to be there for her, and James but he had known us longer so he felt more comfortable talking with everyone. Months go on, she's finally starting to feel like her own person again, and whoopdie fucking do it also turns out we seem to really have good chemistry and enjoy each other's company. And then I realized I liked her as more than a friend, so I tried to cut off from her. Turns out she feels similarly, but neither of us are even sure if it's just the timing of it all (which of course it was). I didn't want to make any moves on her obviously, and I was fine with just being friends. But she kept feeling bad, thinking she was leading me on. I hope she knows she didn't do anything wrong. I fell for her, objectively that whole thing was my fault. And then more and more friends needed help, and I felt like I was going insane from trying to mend things with Kayla while also trying to be a shoulder to cry on for everyone else because no one else fucking would. You know, fuck it, it's gonna take a book for me to write. Bottom line, I kept trying to help my friends and it seems my help is fucking poison. Makes sense that when I finally feel happy about life, and actually think of the future as something that'll last longer than a month to a year from now, I manage to screw over not only my own life but everyone elses' too. If that's what I'm like when I'm trying to be happy, and improve myself into being a better person, then what is the fucking point. I just got sent to the ER yesterday for what I thought was a hernia strangulation and the only reason I had any amount of a fear of death was because I wouldn't have gotten the chance to mend things with everyone. But now I've realized it's a lot simpler than that, the very lack of my presence should mend things just fine.

&amp;#x200B;

If I can't even be good at being a good person, then at least I can be plenty sure that the only reason I'm worth anything to anyone is just because they've known me for a long time. It's like losing a toy as a kid, you're sad about it for a while but then you realize it's just a toy. I have turned to everyone I could, and I got better, and then it turns out that it was better for everyone else that I didn't get better. And before anyone says anything about therapy. I'm sure that would help a bit, but unfortunately I've tried. I live on a small fucking island where there are like 4 therapists total and I can't afford any of them anyway because God bless America or whatever the fuck. I don't doubt people would be sad for a while if I were to die, but even if they don't realize it, it would make their lives a whole lot easier. I haven't decided what to do yet, but death has never been a fear of mine. It's just the dying part that scares me. Always wanted to go out in a heroic movie-style sacrifice type deal. Figure that way I can do one thing right on my way out. If I do anything I think I'll go out into the wilderness where my body won't be found, I imagine it would be a lot easier to accept that I disappeared rather than having to deal with finding my corpse right off the bat.

Idk, I just didn't want people to feel the same way I did. I just wanted to help them, but whether it be because of my childhood or just me, I guess I can't be the person I want to.

I have a very close and supportive friend group, and I finally got out of my depressive loop. I was doing really well in my college courses, had genuine hope for my future career and life. Even handled breakup where I was cheated on like a champ, so that was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, coming out of winter break, one of my best friends (a guy, James) breaks up with one of my other best friends (a girl, Kayla). I&amp;#39;ve been trying to become the sort of person that everyone can be sure will be there for them when they need it. Kayla, is far more closed off and had no one to talk to about all this. So I tried to be there for her, and James but he had known us longer so he felt more comfortable talking with everyone. Months go on, she&amp;#39;s finally starting to feel like her own person again, and whoopdie fucking do it also turns out we seem to really have good chemistry and enjoy each other&amp;#39;s company. And then I realized I liked her as more than a friend, so I tried to cut off from her. Turns out she feels similarly, but neither of us are even sure if it&amp;#39;s just the timing of it all (which of course it was). I didn&amp;#39;t want to make any moves on her obviously, and I was fine with just being friends. But she kept feeling bad, thinking she was leading me on. I hope she knows she didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong. I fell for her, objectively that whole thing was my fault. And then more and more friends needed help, and I felt like I was going insane from trying to mend things with Kayla while also trying to be a shoulder to cry on for everyone else because no one else fucking would. You know, fuck it, it&amp;#39;s gonna take a book for me to write. Bottom line, I kept trying to help my friends and it seems my help is fucking poison. Makes sense that when I finally feel happy about life, and actually think of the future as something that&amp;#39;ll last longer than a month to a year from now, I manage to screw over not only my own life but everyone elses&amp;#39; too. If that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m like when I&amp;#39;m trying to be happy, and improve myself into being a better person, then what is the fucking point. I just got sent to the ER yesterday for what I thought was a hernia strangulation and the only reason I had any amount of a fear of death was because I wouldn&amp;#39;t have gotten the chance to mend things with everyone. But now I&amp;#39;ve realized it&amp;#39;s a lot simpler than that, the very lack of my presence should mend things just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I can&amp;#39;t even be good at being a good person, then at least I can be plenty sure that the only reason I&amp;#39;m worth anything to anyone is just because they&amp;#39;ve known me for a long time. It&amp;#39;s like losing a toy as a kid, you&amp;#39;re sad about it for a while but then you realize it&amp;#39;s just a toy. I have turned to everyone I could, and I got better, and then it turns out that it was better for everyone else that I didn&amp;#39;t get better. And before anyone says anything about therapy. I&amp;#39;m sure that would help a bit, but unfortunately I&amp;#39;ve tried. I live on a small fucking island where there are like 4 therapists total and I can&amp;#39;t afford any of them anyway because God bless America or whatever the fuck. I don&amp;#39;t doubt people would be sad for a while if I were to die, but even if they don&amp;#39;t realize it, it would make their lives a whole lot easier. I haven&amp;#39;t decided what to do yet, but death has never been a fear of mine. It&amp;#39;s just the dying part that scares me. Always wanted to go out in a heroic movie-style sacrifice type deal. Figure that way I can do one thing right on my way out. If I do anything I think I&amp;#39;ll go out into the wilderness where my body won&amp;#39;t be found, I imagine it would be a lot easier to accept that I disappeared rather than having to deal with finding my corpse right off the bat.

,SuicideWatch,"Little intro: I am a college student living with Dyspraxia, ASD, and ADHD. I am pursuing a Finance degree at a major U.S. institution, and am in my 8th of 10 semesters needed to graduate.

I’ve always struggled with organizing things, as is typical of Dyspraxia, but I’ll try to organize this.




Dyspraxia

You probably don’t know what this is. People should--there's not enough awareness out there for it. It’s literal hell to live through. You work 10 times harder than everyone and get nowhere compared to them. You’re constantly being pegged as lazy, when in fact you’re just exhausted from all the work you have to put into everything. Your future, by default, is not very bright because there’s a pretty good chance that you’ll never live on your own, or independently. Couple that with being a male, and things are so much more difficult. At least girls don’t have to worry as much about initiating things as often as guys do. And in fact, research has suggested that girls have it easier with this condition than males, and that is because it is easier for them to recruit their friends when they need help than it is for a guy. 

Couple that with the social awkwardness of Asperger’s syndrome, and life can be mighty difficult. In fact, the average lifespan reportedly for individuals such as myself with Asperger’s syndrome and a learning disability is only 39 (which I identify with in having Dyspraxia). I can see why--life is so fucking stressful--especially if you’re someone who is hellbent on achieving as much as you can in your lifetime like myself. You’re constantly making mistakes--nothing seems to come natural to you. Neurotypicals do not understand individuals with Asperger’s, nor do we understand them. Which makes it no wonder that individuals with Asperger’s Syndrome have been found to be 9 times more likely than the general population to commit suicide. 

College

Right now, for the first time since I've been in college, I'm struggling with all 5 of my classes at once. They are all business courses, and my business school is prestigious to be quite blunt. One of the classes I’m in moves at a super-fast pace in class and I always have to go back through the lectures afterwards to understand shit-- another has exams or quizzes every single class which I hate, yet another contains extremely confusing material, while another requires me to constantly give presentations.

I failed my first 2 exams this semester. Going back to last semester, these represent the 3rd and 4th exam in a row I've failed. Last semester killed me though and I had 5 finals during finals week, and failed the two that I had on the same day, which I will excuse. Still, I am very demotivated when it comes to exams anymore.

In my time here at college, I have learned how to swim, how to ride a bike, a little bit of how to dance, and made some pretty good friends, which are all positive. But all of it was always so difficult.

I hate that I'm in a position right now where I have to cancel my spring break plans because there's an exam 2 days after spring break that I have to do well on, because I bombed the first one. I hate how there's a limit as far as the resources outside of professor's hours where I can get help in the classes I'm in. Further, I constantly fall behind readings because there's just so much in college. 

Further, the trickiness in obtaining help also applies to therapy, which it seems always hard to schedule right when I need it.


Distractions

I spend way too much time pursuing distractions, like playing Words With Friends or paying attention to my favorite baseball team in Spring Training not necessarily for the reward of how it makes me feel but rather to shelter myself from the pain of trying my hardest and then failing in my studies. So I’m constantly procrastinating.


Summer plans disrupted, just like Spring Break plans

I had planned to go on an internship with a company in an another state and city that really intrigued me. Unfortunately, though, the most important medication I am on is government-controlled, can only be given as a 30-day supply, and the pharmacies in the other state cannot guarantee they will fill the medication, with my only other option being pursuing the trouble of finding a psychiatrist down there to diagnose me. I had been accepted for this internship, and both the person who accepted me and myself was really looking forward to that opportunity. But now because of this I am not even guaranteed an internship. I’d have to interview again with this same company at my state’s location. I did not want to stay in my state.


Further, I hate being limited by my medication as to where and when I can travel. Fuck that. And I am someone who would never in a million years abuse pills. Why should I have to pay for that?

Dating

Separately, I hate how dating/getting anywhere with anyone is so complicated for me. I feel like I'll never be able to navigate a relationship--and that's painful. I hate how I always feel the urge to hide who I live with, because I don't feel comfortable telling people I live with my mom. I hate how it seems I never hear appreciation from other people, no matter what I do. 

Cooking

Don’t even get me started on trying to cook… it is so hard for me to coordinate that. It’s also not easy for me to coordinate plans, though that’s not as difficult as cooking. 

Feedback life gives me

I hate all the negative feedback I constantly receive when getting feedback on things from others. It's like no matter what I do, it's never enough. My high school was so easy in comparison to where I am now: I went to one catered for special needs kids. I suppose a positive is that I'm the only one from my graduating class that managed to make it to a major institution, like the one I'm going to, but man it's always been so difficult… 

View on life

I for so long want it to end it all

I am 34 years old and have accomplished nothing, don’t own a house, don’t have money, first I am in a job that I am overqualified for and my superiors to cover and excuse not promotion me point out every little miss steps and project that not finished due to not fault of my own but rather bad decision making from higher up.

Second, I opened business for my own, put all money in it, stupid I know, and now I lost it all.

Broke and in a lot of debt I don’t even know how to start paying it back, bank made a case against me and now I am forbidden form travel, any government services like driving license renewal and bank services \[this a punishment for people that can’t pay back debt in my country\].

In short financially I am screwed, no money or hope in saving any in near future.

And for my family, I am married with two daughters that I would die for but always stressed over how to give them descent life and for my wife I tried to do everything for her but because it was arranged marriage we have nothing in common, not our view of life or opinions in anything, not even our taste in music, movies, television nothing not even on how we manage our house, asked for the extra thing when I couldn’t provide the requirement and the culture here that women should not spend her errand money in the house because it is the man job she didn’t but a single dollar in the house even after she had a job, If I ask her to spend money its will be as a loan after she would insult me mentioning her sisters husbands and how the don’t need help spending on the family .

And the last nail in coffin, she cheated, I was destroyed, after butting up with everything working 14 hours a day to have her and children not felling the crisis I am through and maintain their lifestyle, after pairing with the insults and the horrible treatment.

I feel as though I exist in an endless ocean, hanging on to a soggy plank, I drift In my endless abyss of misery, pondering of a solution, but finding no way out, and having no one to help you. 

I mean, people care about me, but they live in the safety of their shores, endless years away, with no understanding what anything is like, where the water is warm and shallow, where they believe they umderatand what is going on beyond the horizon, they can send advice, tell me to hang on a bit longer, and I try, I truly do, the get out of my miserable ocean that is my life, but after swimming for a while I realize that it will not affect anything, infinite minus anything is still as much, it will never end, no matter how hard or far I swim, life is like a race with no end, and no reason to keep going. 

So I should just end my misery, drown myself in the painful yet numb cold, deep, dark, unknown I call death.

Tonight, might be my last.

,SuicideWatch,"Three weeks ago I told my husband I was going to attempt, he took me to the er, I start taking an anti depressant a few days later, and I go about the next two weeks in misery.

The apathetic kind of misery where I've decided to die and I feel nothing. On Monday my therapist talks to a psychiatrist and they ask me to consider going to a mental hospital. I figure it's probably the right thing to do so I agree and go voluntarily.

It was fucking hell. They violated my rights and were really unkind and short with me. Absolutely everything I've been dealing with got worse. My concentration fell to an all time low. I didn't want to do anything but sleep because that was the only time I wasn't anxious. My vitals were off the entire time I was there. I spent all my time there crying. I couldn't sleep. I'm sure that I would have killed myself on Tuesday if I was physically able to. I just wanted to go to sleep but they wouldn't help me.

I lasted 52 hours there before I discharged myself. My doctor tried to argue with me to stay but I told him that if I couldn't trust the staff then I wasn't going to be able to build up any emotional tolerance to participate in any therapy. So I left.

My husband brought me home and I feel so relieved to be out of there. And now everything just feels fucking weird. I still think about killing myself all the time but the relief has blown away all that misery. Am I terrible for wanting it back? Ever since I've gotten back from the hospital my husband has acted like I'm fine. I know he loves me and knows I'm not, but he's not helping me with the things I need him to. He's not asking if I'm feeling suicidal, which is ironically another complaint I had of the staff at the hospital. I've been begging him to get me out of the house all day but he's so stuck in his anxiety he won't do anything about it. Normally I'd be more sympathetic but his mood has been doing really really well, and it honestly just feels like he's trying to upstage me. I'm so tired of doing everything for both of us. I can't carry on like this.

goddamnit I'm so lost. I feel so weird. Like I want to kill myself, and I feel nothing, but not like apathy and more like acceptance? I feel so at peace and yet I still want to die.

I want that misery back so I can get help. I don't think people will believe me if I say I'm in trouble. 

My biggest fear is that if I attempt I'll fail and will be committed to the hospital I just escaped from. How do I tell anyone I'm desperate for interference while I look and feel so fine.

,SuicideWatch,"hi i’m a guy who just turned 17, here’s some stuff i’ve written in my phone recently that’s never seen the light of day and i’m not sure what i’m hoping to gain from posting it but fuck it

how long can i live like this? all i do is distract myself. whether it be with my ‘friends’ or with the girl i love, i always need to keep my mind off of my mind. when i’m alone and i’ve got time, i fall deep into the dark place inside my head. the thoughts i have are dangerous and self-destructive, and it’s not easy to get myself out once i’m in. my mind is constantly bombarding me with negative thoughts and emotions that i can’t overcome. it controls me. this is the real me. on the outside, i’m known for playing sports, getting good grades, cracking jokes, having fun, and not worrying or stressing over anything. on the inside, everything’s different. i know how dangerous my mind is, and that’s part of why i never let anybody else in. [the other reason is embarrassment. but i’ll get to that later.] i see the thoughts it’s capable of producing and i don’t want anybody in that position but myself. if i’m gonna go down, i’m not dragging anybody else down with me. i’m going to cut my ties and fade away until everybody could care less about me, then i’m gone. minimize the pain. i haven’t reached that point, but i’ve come close on multiple occasions. sometimes i’ll go ghost for a few days at a time and tell myself it’s in hopes that i can see more clearly and figure some things out. “just taking some time to myself.” no. that’s not it. i know nothing’s going to change whether i take a break from communication or not. i go away when i catch myself getting in too deep, when i know i won’t be able to keep my mental state from affecting my personal relationships with people who only know a fake version of me. i go to great lengths to avoid compromising my image because it’s simply too embarrassing. nobody wants to be this fucked up. nobody wants everyone’s sympathy or pathetic attempts to understand what you’re going through. [it makes me mad that everyone around me is so oblivious to what’s going on with me, but there’s no reason i should expect anybody to know. i’ve told nobody. i look nothing but carefree and happy on the outside.] everybody wants to look like their life is perfect. myself included. i’ve kept up this perfect image for so long that i can’t think of a single person who actually knows me. earlier i talked about the way i show myself to everyone else; the version of me that’s on display for the world to see. the ones closest to me actually know me the least; that’s because they’re the ones i’m constantly forcing my fake self upon. my closest family and friends “know” that i have no problems because they assume i’d open up to them if i did. but i can’t. i can’t explain anything going on inside my head. i can’t even force myself to try. it’s unexplainably exhausting leading a double life, but it’s for the best. i wish more than anything that i was normal and this wasn’t how it had to be, but i wouldn’t have it any other way. however, one of the downsides to having nobody i can be myself with is that there’s no break from my misery. i’ve just got to keep pushing and keep fighting myself until it gets to be too much and i can’t take it anymore. i hope one day i’ll be okay, and i hope that day comes before i completely lose my mind. i know the latter is coming. most of the time i genuinely feel like suicide is the best option. people are wrong; it’s not an easy way out. nothing about it is easy. it’s literally a LAST resort when it feels like there are no other options to save yourself. i’ve attempted it twice. it’s not “giving up” as everyone says. it’s accepting that nothing will improve in the foreseeable future, and death is better than fighting a war you cannot win. it’s better than feeling the torture of being physically alive and emotionally lifeless. people who don’t have to deal with being their own worst enemy cannot and will not ever understand. these are the types of thoughts that constantly reside in my mind. it’s not hard to see why i can’t stand it for very long. this is the part of me that i’m constantly battling for control of my mind, thoughts, and actions. the part of me that’s the reason i hate who i am. the reason why i’m constantly searching for relief that nobody knows i need but myself. i’m judged for drinking and smoking by people who can’t fathom how badly i need to get away. i know that for the time i’m heavily under the influence, i won’t think about any of my problems. it’s a feeling that’s invaluable to me, one that i can’t get anywhere else. i say it’s for fun, and that’s such a common theme that nobody questions it.

stress. i’m almost positive that a lot of my stress comes from all of the energy i put into keeping myself hidden from those who think they know me. i don’t consider the version of me that i show everyone “myself.” when i say myself, i mean the real me that nobody’s ever seen. i would love to just let go and let everyone see who i really am, but i’m so entangled in a lie that i don’t think anybody would believe me. the rest of my stress comes from the constant, relentless, never ending pressure i put on myself to succeed. my biggest fear has always been failure. with my mental state, i could easily accept how much of a failure i’ve become recently and give up. nobody gets how hard it is for me to live. the simplest task to someone else seems insurmountable to me. the fear of failure combined with no urge to be productive. for this reason, nobody will understand why i’m giving up. they’ll criticize me for weakness and wonder why somebody with such a “great life” can’t handle a little adversity. they’ll talk about the light at the end of the tunnel when for me, there is no end to any of this. there’s no hope. and they’ll never get it. so my only option is to keep going and continue trying to live up to the impossible expectations i have for myself. continue dragging myself through each day, waiting impatiently to go to sleep again and escape. 

nobody cares. people say they want to help but they aren’t willing or ready to see what’s really in my mind. people who haven’t been to the rock bottom that i’m experiencing every single day can’t relate to anything. anyone who thinks it’s just sadness will try to help with pointless solutions. people don’t understand that being sad and being depressed are completely different. i know that those who ask how i’m doing simply want to know if i’m over the brief period of sadness that they think i’m experiencing. that’s not even close. they haven’t even scratched the surface. but i can’t make them understand, so i’ve simply got to work harder to fake happiness and joy and all the emotions i wish i could really feel.

all i want is success. i know that to find it, i need to put in an unfathomable amount of extra work. however, i can barely handle the bare minimum. i‘m constantly frustrated, exhausted, and irritable. there are already very few things that bring me joy, and now i’m feeling less and less of it when they happen. i want so fucking badly to be normal. instead, i’m fighting always feeling like the walls are caving in on my life; i’m laughing less, having less fun, always on edge; the occasional good mood is more fragile than ever, and one minuscule thought can destroy it. i don’t see a way out of my head. for now, i can still get into the zone and block everything else out for my games, but the minute something goes wrong, i’m back to myself, and it affects my play to the point where i wouldn’t want myself on the ice either if i were my coach or teammate. the opportunity is there; i’m the one holding myself back from the success that i crave so intensely. now, so much time has passed that i’m feeling like i’ve wasted too much of this opportunity. for the last few months, i’ve had a whole other family to present with a fake version of myself. with roommates, there is nowhere i can go to escape when i can’t pretend anymore. i’ve got to keep this up literally 24/7, and it’s killing me. for the period of novelty at the beginning of the season where everything felt perfect, i was distracted from my mind, and i thought i had made it through the storm. out of the woods. but no. i’ve come crashing back down, and it’s made me realize that i don’t think i’ll ever get away from this. i’m not sure how i’ll handle it, or if i’ll just give up. this is always weighing on my mind, and the effects are detrimental enough that it’s hard to put my all into anything. i do as much as i can, but there’s always a part of me that wants to quit everything and doesn’t see a point to all of the work i’m doing. this terrifies me. i’m here to get better, sacrificing so much for the chance to play hockey at the next level, and i’m subconsciously throwing it all away by not taking advantage of everything i have. other people see this too, and if affects their opinion of me. i can’t stand being judged, but if i’m going to continue to keep my mental state a secret, the judgment is just something i have to deal with.",t2_5prlfbpd,False,,0,False,this is torture,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,False,t3_ff5irz,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583661276.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hi i’m a guy who just turned 17, here’s some stuff i’ve written in my phone recently that’s never seen the light of day and i’m not sure what i’m hoping to gain from posting it but fuck it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;stress. i’m almost positive that a lot of my stress comes from all of the energy i put into keeping myself hidden from those who think they know me. i don’t consider the version of me that i show everyone “myself.” when i say myself, i mean the real me that nobody’s ever seen. i would love to just let go and let everyone see who i really am, but i’m so entangled in a lie that i don’t think anybody would believe me. the rest of my stress comes from the constant, relentless, never ending pressure i put on myself to succeed. my biggest fear has always been failure. with my mental state, i could easily accept how much of a failure i’ve become recently and give up. nobody gets how hard it is for me to live. the simplest task to someone else seems insurmountable to me. the fear of failure combined with no urge to be productive. for this reason, nobody will understand why i’m giving up. they’ll criticize me for weakness and wonder why somebody with such a “great life” can’t handle a little adversity. they’ll talk about the light at the end of the tunnel when for me, there is no end to any of this. there’s no hope. and they’ll never get it. so my only option is to keep going and continue trying to live up to the impossible expectations i have for myself. continue dragging myself through each day, waiting impatiently to go to sleep again and escape. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nobody cares. people say they want to help but they aren’t willing or ready to see what’s really in my mind. people who haven’t been to the rock bottom that i’m experiencing every single day can’t relate to anything. anyone who thinks it’s just sadness will try to help with pointless solutions. people don’t understand that being sad and being depressed are completely different. i know that those who ask how i’m doing simply want to know if i’m over the brief period of sadness that they think i’m experiencing. that’s not even close. they haven’t even scratched the surface. but i can’t make them understand, so i’ve simply got to work harder to fake happiness and joy and all the emotions i wish i could really feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;all i want is success. i know that to find it, i need to put in an unfathomable amount of extra work. however, i can barely handle the bare minimum. i‘m constantly frustrated, exhausted, and irritable. there are already very few things that bring me joy, and now i’m feeling less and less of it when they happen. i want so fucking badly to be normal. instead, i’m fighting always feeling like the walls are caving in on my life; i’m laughing less, having less fun, always on edge; the occasional good mood is more fragile than ever, and one minuscule thought can destroy it. i don’t see a way out of my head. for now, i can still get into the zone and block everything else out for my games, but the minute something goes wrong, i’m back to myself, and it affects my play to the point where i wouldn’t want myself on the ice either if i were my coach or teammate. the opportunity is there; i’m the one holding myself back from the success that i crave so intensely. now, so much time has passed that i’m feeling like i’ve wasted too much of this opportunity. for the last few months, i’ve had a whole other family to present with a fake version of myself. with roommates, there is nowhere i can go to escape when i can’t pretend anymore. i’ve got to keep this up literally 24/7, and it’s killing me. for the period of novelty at the beginning of the season where everything felt perfect, i was distracted from my mind, and i thought i had made it through the storm. out of the woods. but no. i’ve come crashing back down, and it’s made me realize that i don’t think i’ll ever get away from this. i’m not sure how i’ll handle it, or if i’ll just give up. this is always weighing on my mind, and the effects are detrimental enough that it’s hard to put my all into anything. i do as much as i can, but there’s always a part of me that wants to quit everything and doesn’t see a point to all of the work i’m doing. this terrifies me. i’m here to get better, sacrificing so much for the chance to play hockey at the next level, and i’m subconsciously throwing it all away by not taking advantage of everything i have. other people see this too, and if affects their opinion of me. i can’t stand being judged, but if i’m going to continue to keep my mental state a secret, the judgment is just something i have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

Eventually, I'll be in full control over my caloric intake, and then I will be capable of starving myself.

I will add dehydration, maybe some sleeping pills, that should do the trick.

I want to go on long car rides in 90 degree weather where my only care in the world is not getting burnt from my seatbelt. 
I want to be secure in my friend group, and not feel like I’m always on the outside. 
Like when you stand in a circle and someone cuts you off- so you’re just looking in through the gaps. 
I’m the funny friend. I make people laugh- I resolve drama, and I try to make everybody happy. But the trouble with being the funny friend is people project their laughter onto you- subconsciously relating the ability to joke with the ability to be happy. The ability to thrive. 
I miss spending nights on my iPod touch playing temple run and hiding it from my parents when they checked if I was sleeping. 
I miss living across the street with my best friend and making forts where we would suck on sour icebreakers and make worlds in our head. 

I’m not doing well nowadays. 
I’ve lost seven pounds in the last month but I’ve been mainly confined to my bed. 
I’ve tried to put myself out there- but it never pays off.  
I am a bad daughter. My grades have taken an all time low, and the very little money that I actually bring in from babysitting is not enough to pay for therapy, medication, or anything else- so they provide for me, with dignity. 

I feel like a burden because I am a burden. 
What do I do besides sit in my room all day and stare at the ceiling?
What purpose do I have in life other than just to reproduce?

I miss who I used to be. I miss that girl. She was a little odd, but she was unapologetically herself. 

The only thing that brings me joy is photography. It’s really the only reason I can be coaxed into leaving my house for an extended period of time. 

My camera is around my neck every moment of every day. I take thousands upon thousands of photos a month- sometimes reaching over a thousand a day.

Going down the highway I think about (and even vison) myself opening the door and just jumping out. Walking over a bridge I vision myself jumping off.. these happen so deeply I literally have to shake them off and shake my head to snap out of it. 
I'm just a bundle full of problems...

A guy who I used to have a casual fling with kept trying to date me officially and asking to be my boyfriend and even hinted at marriage a lot. He wanted to be official with me but I kept saying no. I then stopped talking to him for a bit so he could get over me. He did tell me he was mildly depressed while we were together and in the past he has thought and planned suicide when he was a child but never attempted. Recently, we talked again and he told me he never told anyone this to anyone but he planned his suicide again yet did not go out with the plan. He hinted he was really depressed because we could not date officially like he wanted to. He read his suicide letters to me that he made for people and told me his plan was to go take a bus to NYC and jump off the bridge but he last minute did not end up doing it. I was so sad and worried for him and I asked him try to promise me to never try that again because his friends and family really care for him 
/love him and I tried to talk some hope into his life. He did promise me and he said that he would never actually try to suicide again. But then afterwards he asked if we wanted to be official again. I guess I suppose it is kind of fuzzy to me since all my exes threatened to kill themselves with manipulation in mind so I cannot tell the difference between a legit plan or a way to manipulate me. I did message all his friends and family that he planned a suicide so they could take care of them. He really did not want me to tell anyone because he said he was super embarrassed. But I did anyways with the intention of trying to help him. His mom did take him to a suicidal hospital but he was released the next morning because they did not think he was suicidal when he went. I don’t want to downplay anything because I take it really seriously when I am told this but I guess I am also worried I am bring manipulated. In the end he thanked me for telling his friends and family because he said they helped him.

Becuase I can't seem to find much of a way anymore.

I had my date picked, got everything setup and ready only 10 weeks ago, but people found out in the lead up and I couldn't follow through.

And now I'm right back to that mindset. 

The self harm is back, Im cutting again and now beating myself as frequently as I can, topped with not eating through the day and having a bottle of wine for dinner most nights. Nothing takes the ache in my chest away any more. I can't even cry and honestly feel like an android in a skin suit, like I shouldn't even be real.

I have my dream job, a half failed marriage, two small humans and am close with my family. I had one close friend but he's checked out because I'm too hard to deal with mentally (and honestly I don't blame him), and the other only calls when her shit hits the fan. I've never felt more alone. 

I've completely switched off emotionally and have been overzealously fake happy and enthusiastic around those I know, and not a single person can tell, or has noticed.

And I know that it may hurt them briefly when I'm gone but I also know that they will all be so much better off long term.

,SuicideWatch,"Maybe what I'm going through isn't as big of a problem as you guys do but I still feel like I have to write this.

The story is kinda long but I hope you read it till the end.

So there's this friend group, and there are 5 girls and only 2 guys (including me) in it. I am a really shy person while the other guy is really outgoing and fun. So naturally all the girls hang out with him and not me.

And one of the girls confessed her love to me recently. I was so happy and surprised because I loved her for 3 years but never had the courage to tell her. But she confessed me and we kinda started dating.

The real problem starts here. I can't talk to my girlfriend. All we get when we're together is ""awkward silence"". It's really awful. The guy I mentioned earlier however, has great time with her. They genuinely have fun without me. (plus he has a crush on her, he doesn't know we're dating)

I just want to kill myself and dissapear from their lives, but I don't have the courage to do. I'm also thinking of breaking up with her and leaving the friend group but we have a history together and even if they don't hang out with me as much as they do with the other guy, I still know they like me and care about me.

I need advice. I don't want to feel like this anymore. I am trying to endure this loneliness for 3 years now and I don't think I can do it anymore.

The guy I mentioned earlier however, has great time with her. They genuinely have fun without me. (plus he has a crush on her, he doesn&amp;#39;t know we&amp;#39;re dating)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to kill myself and dissapear from their lives, but I don&amp;#39;t have the courage to do. I&amp;#39;m also thinking of breaking up with her and leaving the friend group but we have a history together and even if they don&amp;#39;t hang out with me as much as they do with the other guy, I still know they like me and care about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need advice. I don&amp;#39;t want to feel like this anymore. I am trying to endure this loneliness for 3 years now and I don&amp;#39;t think I can do it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

So there's this friend group, and there are 5 girls and only 2 guys (including me) in it. I am a really shy person while the other guy is really outgoing and fun. So naturally all the girls hang out with him and not me.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello all,

I feel like I dont have the right to complain. After all from the outside it looks like I've ""made it"". After college I graduated with a bachelor's in nursing and started working at a hospital. I make a great living and moved to the city where most of my friends are. I feel I should be content, great social circle around me, good job that pays well, saving money every month. But the thing is, I still want to kill myself...

I've been a nurse for about a year now. And when I first started I felt I was at a point where I had my anxiety/depression under control. But over time work has just made me so fucking sad. I realized I hate healthcare. I actually started in the ER but chose to transfer to another more manageable floor 4 months in because my depression/anxiety was causing me to have a hard time learning down there.

I still beat myself up and feel like a failure for leaving, I remember being so proud of myself for getting the ER nurse position as a new grad, but it ultimately proved to be too much for my mental health :(.

I've been on this new floor for a while now, it's more manageable. I'm getting into my flow now. But some nights are just so fucking stressful, thinking about work is just as depressing. I dont want to go to work later, nursing in on itself is just physically and mentally draining. I've noticed over time I've become more depressed myself.

I literally party/drink/do drugs pretty much any weekend I can to escape the reality of being an adult in a job I hate. My friends ask me if I'm ok and I just say ""yah I'm fine"". The same with my coworkers as they sometimes notice me zone out (when really I'm in my head thinking about how much I hate being a nurse).

I wish I could just be honest to my coworkers and tell them how I really feel (how sad I've been), but I feel they wont think I'll be competent with my mental health issues. I want to switch to another hospital soon, I just hope things go well with the transfer process, but it's hard find positions on the unit I really want to be in (I'm looking got psych nursing positions, which can still be stressful but psych is something I'm actually very interested in).

,SuicideWatch,"Like everyplace in America, my college is going to take the retarded reactive approach to the coronavirus and wait for a student to get sick instead of proactively closing it. The school is around several elderly communities and nursing homes and hundreds will die when it spreads into the community.

The school is international, kids are traveling everywhere right now. The school banned travel to an anemic list of countries, completely ignoring places the have hundreds of cases and that will have thousands next week.

It’s not a question of if someone brings it back. IT. WILL. HAPPEN. I’m sick of complete disregard institutions have about this disease. Just because your demographic of people (young and healthy) will have minimal loss, doesn’t mean the more vulnerable won’t.

Proactive gets you prepared hospitals and a readied populous. Reactive gets you a nursing home full of dead people.

This day 3 months ago I tried to kill myself by overdosing and woke up the next day. I have spent 3 months dragging myself out of madness and depression to get my life back together. I’m home hours away from school on spring break right now. I’m around the few things I give a shit about. My family, my pets, my home and my hobbies. I have a few acquaintances at school, but no friendships. Besides getting my degree, I’m more or less incapable of giving a shit about anything at school.

I know my school is going to make the wrong choice. It’s the classic “at least it’s not me” situation with a disease that kills less than 0.1% of young adults, but 10% of the elderly. I don’t want to lose my scholarships and grades, but I refuse to go back until this damned virus is gone.

I don’t want to be in a city filled with the elderly and infirm during a pandemic. I don’t want to be quarantined in some kind of structure surrounded by the sick. I don’t want to be isolated from my family. I don’t want to watch this shitshow unfold in a place with nothing I care about and nothing to live for.

At least at home I will have the strength to move forward and get through this. I know myself and how I work. I have autism, loneliness eats my soul, stress, Despair, meaninglessness and hopelessness drives suicidal thoughts. A sustained situation like that will push me off the deep end and will kill me unlike this virus. I’ve been through natural disasters before, a support system like my family is what keeps you going through it. I have nothing for me at college, I merely am a collection of organic matter when I’m there. If I’m forced to go back and I’m right about what is to come, let’s just say there are better things to overdose on...

Edit: I’m not actively suicidal or even depressed right now. I’ve seen pure suffering from my experiences overdosing on hallucinogenic dextromorphin and have been trying to get my life back together with moderate success. I’m still incredibly numb to the world and a feeling of disgust and wrongness still permeates the world around me from what I saw that night. It still haunts me every night in my dreams. It’s going to take months and a good environment to feel “normal” again. I didn’t suffer brain damage, but it has left a psychological toll. I know how I work.

It’s not a question of if someone brings it back. IT. WILL. HAPPEN. I’m sick of complete disregard institutions have about this disease. Just because your demographic of people (young and healthy) will have minimal loss, doesn’t mean the more vulnerable won’t.

Proactive gets you prepared hospitals and a readied populous. Reactive gets you a nursing home full of dead people.

This day 3 months ago I tried to kill myself by overdosing and woke up the next day. I have spent 3 months dragging myself out of madness and depression to get my life back together. I’m home hours away from school on spring break right now. I’m around the few things I give a shit about. My family, my pets, my home and my hobbies. I have a few acquaintances at school, but no friendships. Besides getting my degree, I’m more or less incapable of giving a shit about anything at school.

I know my school is going to make the wrong choice. It’s the classic “at least it’s not me” situation with a disease that kills less than 0.1% of young adults, but 10% of the elderly. I don’t want to lose my scholarships and grades, but I refuse to go back until this damned virus is gone.

I don’t want to be in a city filled with the elderly and infirm during a pandemic. I don’t want to be quarantined in some kind of structure surrounded by the sick. I don’t want to be isolated from my family. I don’t want to watch this shitshow unfold in a place with nothing I care about and nothing to live for.

At least at home I will have the strength to move forward and get through this. I know myself and how I work. I have autism, loneliness eats my soul, stress, Despair, meaninglessness and hopelessness drives suicidal thoughts. A sustained situation like that will push me off the deep end and will kill me unlike this virus. I’ve been through natural disasters before, a support system like my family is what keeps you going through it. I have nothing for me at college, I merely am a collection of organic matter when I’m there. If I’m forced to go back and I’m right about what is to come, let’s just say there are better things to overdose on...

Edit: I’m not actively suicidal or even depressed right now. I’ve seen pure suffering from my experiences overdosing on hallucinogenic dextromorphin and have been trying to get my life back together with moderate success. I’m still incredibly numb to the world and a feeling of disgust and wrongness still permeates the world around me from what I saw that night. It still haunts me every night in my dreams. It’s going to take months and a good environment to feel “normal” again. I didn’t suffer brain damage, but it has left a psychological toll. I know how I work. This dammed virus couldn’t have struck at a worse time in my life. I have the strength to get through this at home, but not in school.I can’t go back to school after spring break..."

I’ve been on meds for years (I stopped taking my meds several months ago because I don’t really think they work much)and have had many therapists but they all just do the same bullshit that’s doesn’t solve anything. Anyways I have a shotgun at my feet right now that I recently bought that I’m going to use but am having second thoughts. Was going to kill myself last night but got really really high and was freaked out that I was really about to kill my self. Also have been using lot of cocaine all day today since I don’t plan on living long. The thing is I’d feel like a pussy if I were to call my mom and tell her crying that I need help because I’m going to split my head in two with a 12 gauge. If I did that then I’d have to hear my fucking family freak out and I’m not sure I can handle that. In all honesty I don't care about anyone on this planet (including my family) and have never been able to form a close relationship with anyone. It seems it would be SOOOOOO much easier to just load a slug and pull the trigger and forget about everything.

,SuicideWatch,"Pretty sure my mother just disowned me for standing up for myself. I have developed insomnia and so it’s hard for me to sleep ever and well tonight I messed up. Let’s start over so you see a bit on why I’m pretty sure I’ve been disowned.

From the moment I could work I have worked. Babysitting, waitressing, hosting, serving. I always tried my best to support myself even from a young age. My first job was at 13 and that was babysitting. My legal first job was Pizza Hut from the moment I turned 16 I worked 6 days a week 5pm to 11pm making barely minimum wage so maybe 3.50 an hour? With hardly any tips. I was expected to pay my insurance, gas, and car stuff, along with anything else I personally needed. I wanted something they refused to buy it for me till I personally could afford it.

My schedule when I was 16 was wake up at 630 in the morning get dressed, go to school, come home, pick up kids and take them back to their moms, go to work till 11, get home and do my chores, eat and go to sleep. That was my schedule my whole junior year of high school. Then when I was a senior they kicked me out for wanting to go out with my friends on a night I had nothing to do. I don’t think they thought I’d actually leave but I packed what I could quickly and walked across town to my best friends and lived with her in the next town over for two years. Every day since I was 16 I was expected to have a job pay my bills do as I was told and to never have my own opinion. Now my sister on the other hand never had to worry about stuff like that. She wanted something they gave it to her. She wanted to go somewhere she got to go.

I understand being the first is a bit more stressful on parents but the blatant disrespect I was getting everyday from my parents was horrible but here I am struggling still. I don’t know why my mothers this way though I’m sure she’s a narcissist but I live on my own in my own apartment with my own job. Sure I might have not done so hot in college but I was doing better than my sister more successful anyways. Where I was living on my own my sister was either living with my mom or couch hopping. Where I would never dream of doing drugs before work she drops acid to pass the time at work. She’s had 10+ jobs in three years I’ve had 7 in four. I know that’s not a good amount I just was struggling with full time job and full time college. Now I’ll be the first to admit I’m an idiot and not very bright but tonight was the final straw.

I’ve always been to timid to stand up to my mom but tonight I did. As I said in the beginning of this I have developed insomnia. Due to said insomnia when I have a break at work I go home and nap if I’m tired. Tonight was one of those nights. Only thing is is I over slept my alarms by 30 minutes and ended up having an hour long break instead of 30 minutes. They called my mom because they couldn’t get ahold of me and she showed up to my house banging on the door and window (I live in an apartment btw) and when I got up to see who was banging she forced her way inside screaming at me about how I need to grow up and sleep when I’m at home not when I’m on break and how I need to stop acting like a child. 

I left and sped back to work since I didn’t have time to deal with her yelling at me and I texted her this when I got to work.

Do not ever speak to me like that again. I am your only successful child and while I may have moments where I act like the 20 YEAR OLD I AM that does not give you the right to speak to me the way you did.

Then write down who you love, listen to your favorite songs. Then open some old photos and look at the good memories» im just gonna stop there.

,SuicideWatch,"My entire family are having fun in life and get mad at me when I say that I suffer. They get to travel, they get to have friends, lovers, coworkers, goals in life, adventures, etc. I've been here stuck at home isolated and suffering for the past 10 years. None of my relatives offered any help at all and just genuinely avoided me my entire life. They never talk to me (except my mom but she just sent me to an exorcist) and if they do they assume I have low IQ and can't understand anything except baby talk (I am 22 years old, have crappy social skills and show no reaction because of my numbness so it gives an illusion of stupidity). If I stop functioning at all, laying in bed all day, they just start screaming at me.

My brother has travelled his entire life, had numerous friends, study opportunities, was loved by my parents and now everybody is worried about him because he couldn't get out of the house for a few months because of his newborn. He was literally visited every week by his friends, has a loving wife he can joke around with, a good independent life... 
I had spent the last 5 birthdays alone and crying my eyes out. No friends, no visitors for years. Always inside the house except for a few days a year when my parents decide to go travel around the country a bit. Talking to myself all the time. Maybe to my mother. That's all. 

He screams at me if I have a mental breakdown while he's visiting.

My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me + cheated on me, and said I was too depressed to take care of her, right after spending Christmas + New Year's together with her family, where i put in all the effort i possibly could.   


My little brother got diagnosed with glaucoma, my dad is now in the hospital too because he's been sick for a month and they don't know what it is   


I had to withdraw from university and repeat in September.   


I've been depressed for 5 years, I thought it would get better and I've been trying so so sooooooooo hard.   


It's my brother's birthday in 3 days, I am so deeply hurt and honestly yes I am suicidal.   


I feel like a complete failure at life, my relationship with my family has been so emotionally traumatic, and this breakup has confirmed my worst fears.   


I don't want to kill myself, and I want to live and have a good life, but I would be lying to you if I didn't say that I feel like my emotional trauma will constantly follow me and ruin everything. And I feel like it's all my fault.   


I feel so fucking stupid, I'm 20 and I feel like a complete fuck up and loser. And worst part is if I am not, then at best I'm such a deeply negative person despite all the therapy, all the medication, and all the effort I am putting in to NOT be a loser.   


I am a kind person, I love my friends, I try my hardest to be a good person, I don't hate anyone, I want to be a father one day, I study something at university so I can help people.   


But I've been crying everyday since beginning of February, I'm tired of googling ""will I find love?"" ""depression success stories"", and I'm tired of being a burden on everyone. I need to go to my friend's birthday party now, and if I feel this horrible tonight I'm calling my doctor and getting myself admitted.

I had a lot more friends when I was younger, and girls seemed more interested in me too.  Now, all I do is go to school, work, hate my life, and then come home to nobody and nothing.

Sometimes I feel like life is a river which fails to let me rest at shore, and keeps carrying me forward... in a life that i do not want to live.I'm tired"
,SuicideWatch,"Hi

I’m a 37 year old male from Singapore. 

I’ve always been a very timid and quiet person because My parents believed children should be seen and never heard and doles out punishments when I speak out of turn or cry. I believe i am a difficult person to love because even my own mother has a tough time showing her concern for me - whenever I’m ill or in hospital, the first thing she does when she sees me is to berate me for ending up in a hospital. T every instance, I had to give in to the demands of my sister - I couldn’t take up driving lessons because there’s only one car in the family and my sister is the only person allowed to drive besides my dad; when my mum found out I applied to a local university she was furious because we only had enough money for her to send my sister overseas to Australia for an expensive education. My sneakers and watch can only be bought from thrift stores but my sister gets the latest most expensive types. I suppose I suffer from an inferior complex because of all this.

I’ve also been having issues at work (I work at a call centre dealing with customer enquirers and feedback) with regards to words and actions of a few individuals and have developed anxiety and depression as well as a fear of people in general.

A new manager came in and started telling us we (the in-house teams) are too expensive to maintain and he is considering outsourcing our jobs altogether simply by virtue of our call/email volume handled even though our customer surveys have always placed us above the third party vendors from teams based in India and the Philippines. This drove up my anxiety because I have bills to pay and can’t lose this job.

I’m also having issues with the admin lady - I feel like she deliberately “misses”, “forgets” or “can’t download attachments” whenever it comes to my administrative matters. For instance, my staff pass expired yet she held off sending on my renewal application for 7 months. What’s worse is that she announced at a meeting that she will NOT open the office doors for anyone who misplaces or forgets their staff pass, even though we have no way of accessing the office without our passes unless someone else opens the doors.

She has also repeatedly cancelled my leave applications, both current and from the previous year presumably because she misread the dates and cancelled them by accident, could not figure out how to download the doctor’s letter for medical leave justification, or simply forgot why she rejected the leave application in the first place (and she yelled at me too when I asked if she remembered the reason for the rejection).

She’s also been copying all the bosses in whenever she finds shortcomings in my administrative matters but refuses to reply when I offered explanations that pay the blame squarely back at her. But she convinced the manager to issue a new directive that all administrative lapses lie solely with the staff and not her as we must also keep track and ensure that she does not make any mistake.

Also, the new manager had taken to raising a complain I had from February and flashing it on screen at meeting after meeting all through to August reiterating the “template” response I gave - it wasn’t a template; I was trying not to say no to the customer and so offered alternatives even from our competitors in hopes of not offending his sensibilities, to no avail.

For months, I’ve had very vivid visions of various scenarios of my death - crossing a road made me visualise a car driving at high speed running me over, climbing up stairs made me see myself falling down them and lying bloodied on the ground. Even walking along a balcony makes me imagine jumping off them...

So, yes I have been driven crazy at work, and my mother-in-law’s passing was the final straw. I snapped and had to be hospitalised for drug overdose. 

I was away from work for 5 months and recently got back to office. Almost immediately I received emails from the admin lady complaining above my administrative lapses during my absence as no one made any leave application on my behalf even though I have informed the manager about this.

So now, I’m afraid of even seeing her. I either suck under the table or tremble when she walks pass. And I’m so afraid of talking to people or even seeing them I hid under a blanket whenever my home door bell rings, and bury my handphone under pillows when they ring. When I visit the mall for a meal, I started hyperventilating and had to walk back outside cause the crowd frightens me. It’s like my entire life is now revolving around avoid people.

And since My return to work, I’ve been having chest pains and difficulty breathing. I feel ill and scared and on some nights, really tempted to just empty all the bills in my mouth, shut my eyes and be done with this exhausting existence... now, with the coronavirus, the Hospitals are swarming with patients and I don’t want to go to ER and trouble anyone further when the medical stuff have so much on their plate already. I really just want to hide at home and avoid everybody but I force myself to get to work to pay my bills. It feels so exhausting... please can anyone share if they have been in similar situations before? 

I really just want to dig a hole and bury myself but my partner needs me now.... he is 24 years older than I am and my secret plan has always been to either kill my self at his funeral (if he passes on) or, to kill myself when the relationship is over because everything I could possibly achieve in this lifetime has been done.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm not sure where to turn to about this. My life has taken a gradual downward dip, over the last several months for the worst. I no longer feel passion in my life to create artwork. I used to before college, and sort of during it. The problem isn't because of college.

I have suffered depression on and off for many years (probably since college days, but again, it didn't happen because of college). I also suffer from anxiety as well. I lay around and sit a lot at home, not doing much of anything. I watch a lot of YouTube and random stuff on tv. I wish my life were more exciting like my friends who have their families started, having amazing careers, traveling the world or any place around them. I do have a loving supportive family. I do have friends who care about me and support me as well. I'm not really open to them about my hardships and my overall condition.

Speaking of friends, not many talk to me. I'm generally the type of person to reach out to help others, ask how they're doing, general talking with common interests to catch up, etc normal stuff. But very few of them ever personally message me in return :( I know life gets busy, so I totally understand. Though, when I send a friend a general message about anything (nothing negative), either it gets left on read or they plain just ignore it with many days or weeks gone by. It feels horrible and extremely discouraging. It makes me feel like giving up talking to anyone. Don't worry, I don't pester them to make them reply. I do wait patiently.

Anywho, many days feel blurred together, doing some of the same things on some days. Existing has now become a choir. I have a weird feeling that I don't even exist. I feel as though my life is on auto pilot, just drifting along to nowhere. It feels completely stagnant. I feel like I'm a ghost, or just something that is around for no purpose at all. From time to time, I do have dark thoughts. You know, the ones where you romanticize various ideas of how to die, or how to self harm? I don't act on them. I haven't, and I don't see myself taking my own life, and not self harming. I just have an overwhelming sadness, and it causes me to cry alone in my room. I hide it pretty well from friends and family. I don't want them to worry about me. I recall opening up to my dad about it before, and it broke my heart watching him cry. Since then, I've kept my depression, sadness, and anxiety to myself. It is really hard to keep this stuff and my thoughts to myself.

&lt;p&gt;I have suffered depression on and off for many years (probably since college days, but again, it didn&amp;#39;t happen because of college). I also suffer from anxiety as well. I lay around and sit a lot at home, not doing much of anything. I watch a lot of YouTube and random stuff on tv. I wish my life were more exciting like my friends who have their families started, having amazing careers, traveling the world or any place around them. I do have a loving supportive family. I do have friends who care about me and support me as well. I&amp;#39;m not really open to them about my hardships and my overall condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of friends, not many talk to me. I&amp;#39;m generally the type of person to reach out to help others, ask how they&amp;#39;re doing, general talking with common interests to catch up, etc normal stuff. But very few of them ever personally message me in return :( I know life gets busy, so I totally understand. Though, when I send a friend a general message about anything (nothing negative), either it gets left on read or they plain just ignore it with many days or weeks gone by. It feels horrible and extremely discouraging. It makes me feel like giving up talking to anyone. Don&amp;#39;t worry, I don&amp;#39;t pester them to make them reply. I do wait patiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anywho, many days feel blurred together, doing some of the same things on some days. Existing has now become a choir. I have a weird feeling that I don&amp;#39;t even exist. I feel as though my life is on auto pilot, just drifting along to nowhere. It feels completely stagnant. I feel like I&amp;#39;m a ghost, or just something that is around for no purpose at all. From time to time, I do have dark thoughts. You know, the ones where you romanticize various ideas of how to die, or how to self harm? I don&amp;#39;t act on them. I haven&amp;#39;t, and I don&amp;#39;t see myself taking my own life, and not self harming. I just have an overwhelming sadness, and it causes me to cry alone in my room. I hide it pretty well from friends and family. I don&amp;#39;t want them to worry about me. I recall opening up to my dad about it before, and it broke my heart watching him cry. Since then, I&amp;#39;ve kept my depression, sadness, and anxiety to myself. It is really hard to keep this stuff and my thoughts to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"First of all i know it'll be extremely long and it's not an extraordinary story. Just a random simple guy.
About ""triggering"" I don't know how can ppl react to simple words or ideas so I'll add it just in case .


I turned 20 this February 23rd. My birthday's kind of recent. A year ago (like, literally in these same months of the past year) i was feeling down too. It was after my birthday and it was at a time i met new ppl who turned into my friends. Like, right now i talk with them a lot and i used to with a girl who was my friend a year ago. She left the career and went to a public college from here to cinematography. She's super happy now, but she was my bff. Weirdly enough that was later. I started feeling better in April of 2019 and she left in May or so. So her leaving wasn't a factor in me being depressed. 

Now, i met new ppl. Can't remember if it was in November/December or January of this year. I had already seen them before. They study the same thing but they are gonna graduate in April/May so i won't be seeing em again...

But that's not the big reason of me being depressed again. The fact that they'll leave sucks a lot though. It seems like getting new friends makes me remember how shitty i am. How worthless i am. They are lovely people. The best I've ever known aside from my family. But I'm in a constant ""they are too good for me"" mood. I keep overthinking what i said or did to them (not something ""bad"" but.maybe something that i think bothers them even if it's probably not the case). I keep thinking I'm just a nuisance. I keep saying how I'm worthless and they still support me, but I don't know if they are being nice to me because they know i selfharm and feel down. I'd like to trust them. They give me a thousands  of reasons, but i simply can't stop doubting. Paranoia I guess. 

I gave one of them, a girl, a David Bowie CD (DB's Legacy i think) because she likes him and even has a tattoo of the lightning. She then gave me a notebook because i like writing. Stories, fiction in general and all kind of stuff actually. She's great. 

There's another girl who's a super super nice person too. She supports me and is like a big sister to me. 

Then there's my bff. He's the second girl's boyfriend. They both are fantastic. He's always there for me. He's simply an awesome lad...

There's more people and i like them too, but aren't as important as the 3 friends i mentioned before. 


My family is FANTASTIC. My two sisters love me and i love them with all my heart. And my parents couldn't be better parents. I absolutely love them too. They support me in whatever i do. They listen to me. They help me. They show their love. We aren't rich, but I've never needed food, i can study without having to work and It's all great, but for some reason they are out of the problem. It's like they are something apart from what's causing me to feel bad. 


Now, i started Selfharming in Feb/March of 2019 and stopped in April. I started doing it again in Feb/March of this year. It all started again as if it was a cycle.

The thought of killing myself appeared in those days and disappeared until now. In the last few weeks the idea has been roaming my head. In the past it wasn't that serious. It was more of a ""how would they react"". I just imagined the situation. 
Today I'm considering it. I wrote a ""testament"" before and i wrote a new one again. I basically thank everyone for being so nice to me. I give a little goodbye to specific individuals. To the 3 friends i mentioned and to other important friends i have and have had.

Triggering: 

I was thinking of cutting my wrists if that's the correct term. Hard to explain in english tbh. I've got a lot of free time after college and I'm usually alone or with my sister at home, but she's always doing whatever she does (hobbies, projects and so) so it's really easy to give it a try. 

Now, to do it i would have to do deep cuts and just imagining it is unpleasant, disgusting, almost painful. The cuts I've done before are/were superficial. 

But I think i have the ""guts"". 

I don't know what i want. Maybe i want to see how they'd react (which isn't possible if I'm dead, i know). Maybe I'm just tired if everything, of feeling so worthless, stupid, ugly and a total shit. Maybe i want attention. Maybe i won't even try it. I don't fckng know. 

When I think about it, my family would be broken. They would tear apart. Everyone would suffer forever. 
I feel too, that I'd waste the opportunity of being alive in a good situation millions of ppl wish they had. 

I don't know if this is a typical crisis we all have, a teenager edgy crisis, a maturing thing. I don't know. Maybe all this grief will pass, I'll look back and will think i was the stupidest, melodramatic, attentionseeking scum ever. 

I'm terrified. Where I'm from suicide is a big problem. A lot of ppl commit this here. I don't like the idea of being no more than a statistic. I don't like the idea of my friends being sad for a week and getting over it so easily, forgetting i existed and how much i tried to be nice. My mom lost a brother 9 years ago approx and though it must be HORRIBLE, it's not like she's thinking about him all day after 9 years and that makes me sad. Not about her not being sad 24/7 but about him nit being remembered all the time.

Just a random simple guy.
About &amp;quot;triggering&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t know how can ppl react to simple words or ideas so I&amp;#39;ll add it just in case .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned 20 this February 23rd. My birthday&amp;#39;s kind of recent. A year ago (like, literally in these same months of the past year) i was feeling down too. It was after my birthday and it was at a time i met new ppl who turned into my friends. Like, right now i talk with them a lot and i used to with a girl who was my friend a year ago. She left the career and went to a public college from here to cinematography. She&amp;#39;s super happy now, but she was my bff. Weirdly enough that was later. I started feeling better in April of 2019 and she left in May or so. So her leaving wasn&amp;#39;t a factor in me being depressed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, i met new ppl. Can&amp;#39;t remember if it was in November/December or January of this year. I had already seen them before. They study the same thing but they are gonna graduate in April/May so i won&amp;#39;t be seeing em again...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s not the big reason of me being depressed again. The fact that they&amp;#39;ll leave sucks a lot though. It seems like getting new friends makes me remember how shitty i am. How worthless i am. They are lovely people. The best I&amp;#39;ve ever known aside from my family. But I&amp;#39;m in a constant &amp;quot;they are too good for me&amp;quot; mood. I keep overthinking what i said or did to them (not something &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; but.maybe something that i think bothers them even if it&amp;#39;s probably not the case). I keep thinking I&amp;#39;m just a nuisance. I keep saying how I&amp;#39;m worthless and they still support me, but I don&amp;#39;t know if they are being nice to me because they know i selfharm and feel down. I&amp;#39;d like to trust them. They give me a thousands  of reasons, but i simply can&amp;#39;t stop doubting. Paranoia I guess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave one of them, a girl, a David Bowie CD (DB&amp;#39;s Legacy i think) because she likes him and even has a tattoo of the lightning. She then gave me a notebook because i like writing. Stories, fiction in general and all kind of stuff actually. She&amp;#39;s great. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s another girl who&amp;#39;s a super super nice person too. She supports me and is like a big sister to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s my bff. He&amp;#39;s the second girl&amp;#39;s boyfriend. They both are fantastic. He&amp;#39;s always there for me. He&amp;#39;s simply an awesome lad...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s more people and i like them too, but aren&amp;#39;t as important as the 3 friends i mentioned before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family is FANTASTIC. My two sisters love me and i love them with all my heart. And my parents couldn&amp;#39;t be better parents. I absolutely love them too. They support me in whatever i do. They listen to me. They help me. They show their love. We aren&amp;#39;t rich, but I&amp;#39;ve never needed food, i can study without having to work and It&amp;#39;s all great, but for some reason they are out of the problem. It&amp;#39;s like they are something apart from what&amp;#39;s causing me to feel bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, i started Selfharming in Feb/March of 2019 and stopped in April. I started doing it again in Feb/March of this year. It all started again as if it was a cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thought of killing myself appeared in those days and disappeared until now. In the last few weeks the idea has been roaming my head. In the past it wasn&amp;#39;t that serious. It was more of a &amp;quot;how would they react&amp;quot;. I just imagined the situation. 
Today I&amp;#39;m considering it. I wrote a &amp;quot;testament&amp;quot; before and i wrote a new one again. I basically thank everyone for being so nice to me. I give a little goodbye to specific individuals. To the 3 friends i mentioned and to other important friends i have and have had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Triggering: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of cutting my wrists if that&amp;#39;s the correct term. Hard to explain in english tbh. I&amp;#39;ve got a lot of free time after college and I&amp;#39;m usually alone or with my sister at home, but she&amp;#39;s always doing whatever she does (hobbies, projects and so) so it&amp;#39;s really easy to give it a try. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, to do it i would have to do deep cuts and just imagining it is unpleasant, disgusting, almost painful. The cuts I&amp;#39;ve done before are/were superficial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think i have the &amp;quot;guts&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what i want. Maybe i want to see how they&amp;#39;d react (which isn&amp;#39;t possible if I&amp;#39;m dead, i know). Maybe I&amp;#39;m just tired if everything, of feeling so worthless, stupid, ugly and a total shit. Maybe i want attention. Maybe i won&amp;#39;t even try it. I don&amp;#39;t fckng know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I think about it, my family would be broken. They would tear apart. Everyone would suffer forever. 
I feel too, that I&amp;#39;d waste the opportunity of being alive in a good situation millions of ppl wish they had. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if this is a typical crisis we all have, a teenager edgy crisis, a maturing thing. I don&amp;#39;t know. Maybe all this grief will pass, I&amp;#39;ll look back and will think i was the stupidest, melodramatic, attentionseeking scum ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m terrified. Where I&amp;#39;m from suicide is a big problem. A lot of ppl commit this here. I don&amp;#39;t like the idea of being no more than a statistic. I don&amp;#39;t like the idea of my friends being sad for a week and getting over it so easily, forgetting i existed and how much i tried to be nice. My mom lost a brother 9 years ago approx and though it must be HORRIBLE, it&amp;#39;s not like she&amp;#39;s thinking about him all day after 9 years and that makes me sad. Not about her not being sad 24/7 but about him nit being remembered all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m scared of what&amp;#39;ll happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"So, if you’re like me and you have clinical depression, then you know that being suicidal isn’t typically you just start getting depressed and want to die, it’s kind of a constant thing all the time. (At least for me it is)

And by that, I mean you could be happy, and it’s just in the back of your mind aaaaallllll the time. Or excited and with a group of friends and that voice in the back of your head is just like we could be dead right now. Or your sitting with some family chatting and it just slides across your mind for no reason. You don’t have to be depressed constantly. It’s just that chemical imbalance that makes your brain say ay let’s die right now. 

And for me medication helps me manage that constant call of death. It doesn’t make it go away, if you have depression you know what I mean, but it helps it dull it down from super severe to a level you can manage and live with on a day to day basis. 

So why am I making this post? 
I’m about to run out of medication, and normally a simple call to my therapy/medication office would fix that issue but I just moved to a different state and I don’t have access to a behavioral health place anymore. And my anxiety is literally eating me from the inside out because of this. 

If you’ve ever been cut off cold turkey from medication you know one thing- it is not heckin fun. I’ve done this a few times and each time have been in the hospital. It just not a fun time. So I’m terrified of this happening once again.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle it?

18M, college student

I was homeschooled through the first portion of my life, witch usually is a good thing. I've heard many a success story from going this route, but I cannot say this is true for me.  Enter my first reason: grades suck.

I don't like my mother for doing this (my father did none of the homeschooling). I've ended up learning nothing, (now seeing this in college,) and wasted my entire childhood.  This, combined with her consistently changing and unsatisfiable standards, has sown a good deal of animosity between her and I. So much so that I want to see her in pain.

I would find a knife simply to inflict the pain of loosing her firstborn onto her. (Reason 2). 

I don't have any assets. My parents (again, my mother calls all the shots) have structured my life so that I can go to college and get the degree they want, while having no mobility (car, job) of my own. 

They won't give me a car (because of grades) so that I can't get a job (no jobs in this area have let you not have a car. All require them). So me getting away from them like that isn't an option.  (reason 3) Dropping out after 2 years in college would only be a) a personal let down and b) I would have no standing ground to have them give me a car.

 Financial mobility (reason 4) is completely dedicated to them. Any gifts, any money i get must go to them. Any fun I have I must ask them first.  This is a peice of the contract for me to go to college.  (Btw, I don't know what I enjoy, therefore not knowing what to do for fun, nor do I know of anything I would like to try, hence not enjoying myself.  Except for when I am dragged along to go with my mother so that she can enjoy herself. I don't consider it fun)

They have also made it abundantly clear that the phone I have, the computer, the bed I sleep in, is theres. And i am permited to use it. Privacy, (reason 5) was also something I only recently strongarmed into my favor, just enough to write this. And this can 'also be taken away at any time'. 

My problem lies in not only my mostly uncontrollable situation, but in wanting to cause pain to people.

It would have the desired effect, and with little imaginable ripple effect. The only person I would be un intentionally hurting is my dad. Kind and fair person when he has the room to parent.

I don’t blame anyone for this, because I’ve always known that I am the only reason why I am end up here.

And my only brother who is just 2 years older than me started mentally abusing me for  almost 10 years, but I couldn’t resist him one single time. And that experience makes me more reversed, shy kid, and even I haven’t experienced any kind of bullying in school, I’ve always afraid of my peers.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello

I am sorry if you have to read this, I just want to vent a little.

Every now and then I will start thinking that dying is the only option for me. Events that should make me happy (getting into college, getting a job, etc.) haven't really made me happy at all. I just feel more empty. I'm not sure why I don't feel happy, as these events are clearly joyful in their own right, and that just makes me think that something's wrong with me.

I'm not particularly lonely, and I like to be alone. These days I feel too tired to do anything. Going out and meeting new people is exhausting, and I generally don't like going out. It's too tiring and too much of a hassle. Everything is tiring. I used to get angry, sad, happy. But now... now, I'm just in a constant state of mild irritation and much too tired to feel anything else. I'm too tired to get angry. Nothing making me feel joy anymore. Listening to music, playing games, watching TV, surfing the internet have all made me feel nothing. I'm losing motivation to do more than half of these things.

I'm not sure what made me this way. I don't know what exactly is wrong with me. The idea that something being wrong with me just make me hate myself even more. I hate how I'm too tired to go out with friends. I hate how I have no motivation to play games. I hate how I feel constantly irritated. And most of all, I hate how I can't seem to do anything about it.

It's difficult for me to console my parents because they don't quite believe in depression or sadness, and honestly, from a bystander's standpoint, I should have nothing to complain about my life. Hence, I feel like... my depression isn't even good enough for actual depression, if that makes sense? Might sound a bit odd, but I feel like I'm not sad enough to actually be, well, you know, depressed. I haven't self-harmed, and while I do want to die, I'm too afraid to actually do anything for myself.

I'm terrified of even telling real life friends or people about this. Some may call me selfish, others may talk about the consequences of what I desire. ""What will my family think about this?"" I'm not sure, maybe that's why I haven't been able to kill myself. I also don't want to burden anyone with these thoughts, but if anyone is reading this, I may have done so to you. And I'm sorry about that. I'm really sorry. 

I'm just... exhausted. Really tired of it all. Can't get a good night's sleep. I don't know. Maybe death is when I'll finally have a good rest. Not sure what to do. I'm so tired.

,SuicideWatch,"First things first, I'm 19, I was diagnosed ADHD, broad spectrum autistic and Asperger's when I was 3, later diagnosed with an antisocial personality disorder at 12, depression at 14 and anxiety at 17, I was medicated for ADHD from ages 3 to 16 and did 4 months anger management therapy when I was 15 to no noticeable result

I can't afford to see a therapist and the only free Avenue for therapy I know of near me is headspace, who straight up tell me they can't help everytime I talk to them

I'm also very political, I have been since I was 14 and I've become very anti capitalist and anti authoritarian, which only serves to make me angry at things I can't change

Ive attempted suicide 5 times that I remember, twice hesitating at the last second before jumping in front of a train, once tried to overdose on my ADHD medication and twice tried to drink myself to death

The only person I've spoken to since January is my dad and spoken is a bit strong of a word, we barely know eachother as I was raised by my mother and he's completely useless as a father, I'm only living with him because I wanted to leave the small town mum raised me in and now I can't afford to leave here

I haven't slept in 2 days straight, didn't even know it was March until less than a minute ago and everything either bores me to the point where I get angry or just straight up makes me angry, I also haven't eaten all day, last thing I ate was Mac and cheese for lunch yesterday

I've had a lot of violent outbursts, too many to remember, most notable being when I hospitalised someone who'd been bullying me, he pushed me too far and I snapped, then his arm snapped

I've got no friends I can talk to, all my friends from highschool pretty much forgot about me when I dropped out and last time I tried to have a night out I nearly stabbed someone at a club but forced myself to leave before anything happened and ended up blind drunk just wandering around looking for something to fix me and not finding it

Recently realised how lucky I am Australia has good gun laws, or I would've shot up my school then put the gun in my mouth multiple times over

English is not my first language. So some of the things that characterizes me I believe are: depression, sensitivity, sluggish cognitive tempo (sct), social anxiety and asd(have diagnosis).

Due to this and the things I've listed before, without sufficient self-awareness life can become quite miserable without me realizing it.

When I was 12-13 years old, it was good, i had some friends, but at 14 I lost almost everyone for different reasons and entered in a deep depression.

And at 17 I entered in an abusive relationship, in which he would control anything i did, raped me 2 times and even beaten me

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 15, and it's been 2 years already since I wanted to stop existing. I'm just disappointing myself every day. I really need to talk to someone about this, but whenever I do people don't take me sireously. I'm asking fro honest help, I can't resist this feeling anymore.

I have decided to kill myself - Not a question, but rather a fact that will happen. However, instead of doing it randomly or out of some emotional state, I have decided to do it because I am bored (Lazy?) and just honestly don't want to deal with life anymore. I do, however, want to avoid being a problem to my family. I have some debts (credit cards, car, and student loans) that I want to pay off first as well as raising enough to pay for my own funeral and cremation so my family will not have to pay a dime. I have estimated it will take about 5 years for me to complete all these with this being my single focus in what is left in my life. 

  
My question is, does this make me a sociopath? I feel no negative emotions when I think about it, and honestly, I just feel revealed that I have a goal I am working towards that I actually care about for once. I am not an underprivileged person and have had lots of chances to connect with people and find passions and hobbies. They all seem horribly boring and not worth putting in the effort for. I find myself regularly wondering why I am doing something. Why do the dishes when they will just get dirty again ? I switched to paper and plastic utensils and plates. Why put in the effort to maintain relationships and find new ones when it is so much work? I have, fairly successfully broken ties with everyone, allowing for time with family or important friends a couple times a month. My answer to all of this was to plan my own suicide 5 years from now. Nothing extravagant or anything, just buy a gun in the next 2 years and 3 years after put a bullet in my head. I am not trying to make a point or make someone feel bad about me being gone, I am just tired and I don't want to do it anymore.  


With all this being said, you may be wondering why I would be willing to work and earn the money to pay off my debts before doing it. My answer to that is that I may not care about myself at all, but I do still care about my family and their well being. I don't want to put them in any additional hardships past what I already plan to do.   


So - this has been much longer than I thought it would be, but would this make me a sociopath or is there a term for it? Maybe something for being emotionally dead towards yourself, feeling bored with life, or tired with everything and just wanting it all to stop?

,SuicideWatch,"Spurred by a drought in alcohol- I've stopped for 19 days- I'm overcome with rather rational observations of my situation; the life of a once promising 31-year old struggling for society's essentials, house, job, girlfriend.

I've started reading the book 'The Untethered Soul', in hopes of redeeming myself. It is one of those spirtual books, but in essence it just tells me to open up and let the traumas flow through me to release them. I've stuck with it for a couple of monts.But then I figured that this book is written for ordinary people with ordinary minds and the natural drive to cling for life.

I don't cling to life nor do I cling to death.

Some days I feel like the character Oblomov, a noble but very lazy Russian aristocrat who sleeps his life away pondering what to do next.It especially strikes me at those daily times where I see my father lying on the couch with his arms crossed over his chest, like a man waiting for his death, bestowed with all the sins my mother attributes to her unfulfilled life. I recognise Oblomov's high plans without the passion and drive to just begin, one step at a time.How I've envied the makers, the creators of this world. There are many things I'm good at, there truly are. But I've only fought for them with a knife on my throat, when the water was near my lips and the only sensible thing I could do was buying time, hence tackling the case. Be it exams, be it work, be it friends.

Make no mistake; this episode, it's a familiar one. Similar feelings occured in my twenties, similar feelings in my teenage years. There's but one difference; the diminishing hope since then. Now I truly feel written off for society. If there were a story about me later on, it could only be about a lost soul finally getting his life together, not a success story, only the tale of amends.

Like me, Oblomov is passionate about nothing. And when he is passionate, the flames soon fade away.

It's oblomovitis.

\--------

A week ago I've heard about the upcoming film  of a real story 'The Silent Twins', where two twin sisters developed an estranged bond together that escalated in robbery and arson.I've had this weird bond with my own twin brother, for better or worse. Always feeling a bit exposed to his likeness, always holding back a little too.Nonetheless, we are not talking much, but nonetheless he is doing alright. And I am not, and I feel the competition between us when we're together at family gatherings. And I know he compares, and I know I've always gotten the most attention. Earlier today I casually replied 'I'm growing a moustache' after his stare to my stubbles.

His response was 'our moustaches would be the same if I had one'. I hated that. There are so many differences between us, yet he feels like comparing. Many people feel like comparing, my mother, my father, random people I meet in public transport, in the library. I'm so anxious about maintaining the little uniqueness I have.It's such a bizarre twist of faith that he's the done doing better now. And I'm thankful, and I hope he'll find a way to make his own life sustainable.

And then it dawns upon me; one or the other. I've prayed for this during his troubled times-depression, drug abuse, etc.; I said ""God, if it can't be done any other way. Take my fortune for the wrongs I did him in the past, for my overshadowing of him. Take it and let him find his way.""

I've asked for this, quite a number of times. You cannot believe the number of job rejections I've gotten in the past half year. It's not for lack of talents; arrogant as I am, I'm fully aware of my talents, rather of my poise to do better than others.

That early wish of mine however, it radiates through my voice, through my eyes.They're right; I don't really want their jobs. I crave them. Like an addict I don't want to show my necessity. To downplay is better than to beg, even if just with my eyes.

There's just one regular occurence that does not quite match the forlorn life in my head; the looks I get from people; I'm not particularly handsome nor loud or brawny, yet whenever I get on a train, enter a library or a pub by myself, I see the baffled stares from time to time. It could be a girl with those big anime-like eyes staring at me. It could be a man just looking joyful at me. I sometimes wonder if something speaks through them perhaps. That, or my mind is falling apart, for loneliness is a disease; it's noticeable in the mirror; my glance has gotten a vacant magnetic dimension to it, taking in any possible company.

All things considered, this gloom is a familiar feeling. I know what could come next; fruitless hope.There is just the one prevailing pattern through my life; sparks out of a dying flame.

But I've only fought for them with a knife on my throat, when the water was near my lips and the only sensible thing I could do was buying time, hence tackling the case. Be it exams, be it work, be it friends.

Make no mistake; this episode, it's a familiar one. Similar feelings occured in my twenties, similar feelings in my teenage years. There's but one difference; the diminishing hope since then. Now I truly feel written off for society. If there were a story about me later on, it could only be about a lost soul finally getting his life together, not a success story, only the tale of amends.

Like me, Oblomov is passionate about nothing. And when he is passionate, the flames soon fade away.

It's oblomovitis.

\--------

A week ago I've heard about the upcoming film  of a real story 'The Silent Twins', where two twin sisters developed an estranged bond together that escalated in robbery and arson.I've had this weird bond with my own twin brother, for better or worse. Always feeling a bit exposed to his likeness, always holding back a little too.Nonetheless, we are not talking much, but nonetheless he is doing alright. And I am not, and I feel the competition between us when we're together at family gatherings. And I know he compares, and I know I've always gotten the most attention. Earlier today I casually replied 'I'm growing a moustache' after his stare to my stubbles.

His response was 'our moustaches would be the same if I had one'. I hated that. There are so many differences between us, yet he feels like comparing. Many people feel like comparing, my mother, my father, random people I meet in public transport, in the library. I'm so anxious about maintaining the little uniqueness I have.It's such a bizarre twist of faith that he's the done doing better now. And I'm thankful, and I hope he'll find a way to make his own life sustainable.

And then it dawns upon me; one or the other. I've prayed for this during his troubled times-depression, drug abuse, etc.; I said ""God, if it can't be done any other way. Take my fortune for the wrongs I did him in the past, for my overshadowing of him. Take it and let him find his way.""

I've asked for this, quite a number of times. You cannot believe the number of job rejections I've gotten in the past half year. It's not for lack of talents; arrogant as I am, I'm fully aware of my talents, rather of my poise to do better than others.

That early wish of mine however, it radiates through my voice, through my eyes.They're right; I don't really want their jobs. I crave them. Like an addict I don't want to show my necessity. To downplay is better than to beg, even if just with my eyes.

\-----

There's just one regular occurence that does not quite match the forlorn life in my head; the looks I get from people; I'm not particularly handsome nor loud or brawny, yet whenever I get on a train, enter a library or a pub by myself, I see the baffled stares from time to time. It could be a girl with those big anime-like eyes staring at me. It could be a man just looking joyful at me. I sometimes wonder if something speaks through them perhaps. That, or my mind is falling apart, for loneliness is a disease; it's noticeable in the mirror; my glance has gotten a vacant magnetic dimension to it, taking in any possible company.

All things considered, this gloom is a familiar feeling. I know what could come next; fruitless hope.There is just the one prevailing pattern through my life; sparks out of a dying flame.

I stress this: I am not suicidal, but can I leave the table, throw my cards down? Heart problem, falling counterweight, car crash, I don't have a preference. Just anything that would not lead to surpass the feelings of sorrow after a natural death.Deus Ex Machina, come kill me in my sleep"

,SuicideWatch,"Sorry for the long post. I'm trying my best to articulate how I'm feeling right now.

Hi, I'm an 18 year old male currently attending a community college in southern California. 

  
In high school, I didn't have much friends, and I didn't do many extra extracurriculars. The only thing that I focused on was maintaining my GPA. Shit started to go down hill when I took honors pre-calc during the junior year. That class was literally hell for me, and I ended up getting a C. I remember talking to my only group of friends at that time. I told them about my C, and they were like ""nah, there's no way you're getting into UCSD."", which was my dream school. My dreams were crushed, and I lost motivation. Things never got better towards the end of that year, and into senior year. My grades started to slip, and I felt excluded from my friend group because of my poor grades. 

When admissions came around, I was devastated to hear that I didn't get into my dream school. To make matters worse, I was the only one in my group of friends who did not get into UCSD. Even my own twin brother got into the school. I was depressed all throughout summer. Nothing was more depressing than being CONSTANTLY compared to my twin brother who was better than me in every single aspect of life. He tries to rub it in my face every chance he could. All this emotional turmoil really bothered me and caused me to have a bad relationship with my parents. I later decided to go to community college instead of SDSU (the safety net school that I got into) so that I could get another shot at UCSD. 

I started off community college strong with a 4.0 during my first semester. I thought things were going to turn around for the better, but it really didn't. During my break, I had a lot of time to myself so I ended up feeling depressed. I couldn't help, but think about how much better people are doing at 4-year universities. It made me think of how I could've went to SDSU instead. My second semester had just started about a month ago, and it already started on a bad foot. I failed my first exam for physics. Right away, I started thinking to myself ""am I capable of transferring well?"". I also frequently started to think about my own mortality a lot as well. Someone on my mom's side recently passed away from cancer, and although I was not super close with that person, I couldn't help, but think about death, the legacy I will leave behind, etc. 

I tried to talk to my parents about my depression in the past, but they just don't seem to understand. They don't seem to understand the difference between ""stress"" and ""depression"". They just call me ungrateful for complaining when they did so much to support me and how so many kids would love to have a loving mother and father. They just love to talk down on me.

I've had CT scans, MRIs with and without contrast, physical therapy, and nerve block surgery. I don't know what to do anymore and all I get is, No thats not what you have. Period. Help please. I'm a prisoner in my own bodyIm losing my sanity to chronic pain and depression."

,SuicideWatch,"Recently, I've realized just how important variety and freshness is in everyday life. I know that many of the tips I will list below are not possible when you are in a particularly dark place, but I thought I'd mention them anyway — perhaps something will be of help to you. Here are a few things that help me keep overwhelming bouts of anxiety and ideation at bay: 

* Push yourself to wake up a little earlier. Stretch slowly with deep breaths and take a walk around your neighborhood as the sky turns rosy-yellow. Try to appreciate the new day; think of something, anything, to look forward to. Return home for a  warm shower and freshly-laundered clothes.
* Sleep a little bit earlier. Wash your sheets and buy a few soft blankets to make your bed into a cozy sanctuary. Allot time for reading or journalling to clear your mind.
* Allot time to cook simple, lovely meals. Steam fresh vegetables, cook some rice, or cut up a fruit salad of apples, bananas, and citrus. Eat mindfully and drink plenty of water. 
* Buy a well-bound journal and a good quality pen. Write down achievable to-do lists, make calendars, note groceries, thoughts, haikus —  anything. Put your thoughts in ink; appreciate daily observations. 
* Reorganize your space, or at least a little section of it. Listen to a nice podcast as you do so. Put your sheets and pillowcase into the laundry. Clear out your shelves and drawers, sort through everything, and replace it all neatly. Light a lovely candle and add some fresh flowers. Open a window or two.
* Buy or borrow a book on any topic which sparks even the slightest interest. Crocheting? Botany? Medieval history? Delving into a new topic just for the sake of it is worthwhile.
* Embrace non-competitive hobbies. This is incredibly important in a product(ivity)-obsessed society which devalues craftsmanship and pure interests. Activities like the following enrich your daily life and force you to set aside some time away from mandatory tasks: needle-felting, gardening, writing (poems, books, articles, blogs), painting, photography, wood-whittling, typography, graphic design, etc. Ensure that whatever you choose, the hobby involves holding the  fruits of your labor in your hands.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push yourself to wake up a little earlier. Stretch slowly with deep breaths and take a walk around your neighborhood as the sky turns rosy-yellow. Try to appreciate the new day; think of something, anything, to look forward to. Return home for a  warm shower and freshly-laundered clothes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep a little bit earlier. Wash your sheets and buy a few soft blankets to make your bed into a cozy sanctuary. Allot time for reading or journalling to clear your mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allot time to cook simple, lovely meals. Steam fresh vegetables, cook some rice, or cut up a fruit salad of apples, bananas, and citrus. Eat mindfully and drink plenty of water. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy a well-bound journal and a good quality pen. Write down achievable to-do lists, make calendars, note groceries, thoughts, haikus —  anything. Put your thoughts in ink; appreciate daily observations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reorganize your space, or at least a little section of it. Listen to a nice podcast as you do so. Put your sheets and pillowcase into the laundry. Clear out your shelves and drawers, sort through everything, and replace it all neatly. Light a lovely candle and add some fresh flowers. Open a window or two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy or borrow a book on any topic which sparks even the slightest interest. Crocheting? Botany? Medieval history? Delving into a new topic just for the sake of it is worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace non-competitive hobbies. This is incredibly important in a product(ivity)-obsessed society which devalues craftsmanship and pure interests. Activities like the following enrich your daily life and force you to set aside some time away from mandatory tasks: needle-felting, gardening, writing (poems, books, articles, blogs), painting, photography, wood-whittling, typography, graphic design, etc. Ensure that whatever you choose, the hobby involves holding the  fruits of your labor in your hands.

Though you wouldn’t think that if you met me. Every day I slap on a smile and ask myself, “what kind of beauty am I going to see today?” and I allow life to flow. People say I’m so nice and so happy, so fun and charming. I had gotten so good at it I had even convinced myself for the passed 10yrs that I’ve been happy. Truth is though I don’t think I’d know happiness if it hit me in the face. 
I think I’ve been depressed since young childhood, coming from a wildly dysfunctional military home, being constantly bullied, I turned to sex drugs and alcohol at a very young age in order to cope. Now I’m 25, in a big city, feeling more isolated than ever. I work two jobs, I was going to university but decided to drop out to do a trade.

About half an hour and a half later when my mum was going to bed I woke to see her standing at my door. I was half asleep so I said “I’m trying to sleep” and she apologised and went to bed

The next morning I questioned her on why she stood at my door and she said “Every night I say goodnight and it’s not just to remind you it’s for me to check you’re still alive but last night you didn’t respond and I went to go to bed but I stopped went back an said goodnight through the door again and you didn’t answer so I opened the door and thought oh she’s asleep but then as I walked a way a voice in my head said you were dead so I stood at your door waiting to see you breathe.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi everyone,

I've been struggling with depression for most of my adult life. I tried to kill myself in 2013 at age 22, but I failed. Got some help from psychiatrists, which got me past the suicidal stage, but I never actually got to the point where I *wanted* to live. I accepted that I shouldn't end my life, but I haven't really enjoyed living since then.  
I've tried getting some help recently when I started having suicidal fantasies, but I was rejected for (publicly funded) psychiatric treatment, because my symptoms weren't severe enough. I'll try to get referred to a psychologist, so I can get some help (and possibly a second opinion).

In the moment I just say fuck it and quit and move on to another, I dropped out and am an alcoholic. I cant clean because it feels hopeless as well, everything just piles up until I'm at this point, and this time i dont know if i can move on. My dreams are repetitive and of the same person, and i cant shake that no matter what i try. Right now just seems like the time to save my family the pain of doing it later and just ending it. I dont know what to do. I want to make an impact on the world but know the chances are oh so slim, and it seems a lot easier to die.Suicidal thoughts. Please help if you can."

Bit of backstory my boyfriend (5 years) had called me while I was at work on Monday saying that he was checking himself into a mental health hospital. I knew roughly why he would be there but it was still such a shock to me. It wasnt until a few days later that he opened up to me and said that he had made a plan and chose out the weapon but decided after his therapy session that he didnt want to do it anymore. So it's a weird in between spot. While he didnt necessarily attempt suicide he was damn close. Closer than I ever could have imagined.
I had just started a new job with a bakery about a month ago and then this happened. I've had a hard time coping with everything and so I told my boss I probably wouldn't be back until the following Monday. Fast forward to Friday I get a call from one of my friends who helped get me the job and she's saying that my work team is trying to be understanding but that they think and my friend thinks I'm being immature and irresponsible for not going to work. My friend even went far enough to say that maybe I wasn't strong enough for my boyfriend since I couldn't find it in myself to go to work through this. 
I guess I'm asking for advice. My friend said my work is talking about cutting my hours since now I've shown I'm not reliable even though before this happened I had never so much as shown up late before or called out. What would you do? I feel at a loss because yes I realize I should be working but I don't know how to face my work after this especially knowing they are annoyed with me.Boyfriend had suicide plan"

,SuicideWatch,"Howdy. I don't know why I'm posting like it's going to do anything for me but whatever. This is gonna be pretty wordy. A fella out here fighting the long fight. Everything's shit. Everything's been shit since I was like 11. There hasn't been a day in at least 5-6 years that suicide hasn't crossed my mind. I've managed to stay pretty functional. Less so now. I can't do anything. I'm used to having bad days. I'm used to that. But for the longest time my bad days were maximum 17 hours in bed then I get up to piss or something. It's different now. My bad days are 31 hours in bed no food or water. I don't go online, I don't talk to anyone, I just sulk. Everything's gone to shit. 

My family is big against any sort of therapy/mental illness sort of talk. I was too. Last year in August I broke down and started therapy because I knew I was slacking. I decided If not to change my mood, then to at least change my behavior. It helped for a while. Cut to December. I'm off my shit. I break down again and resort to meds. I've always been against meds for myself so idk maybe that adds some perspective. I felt like meds were the equivalent of me giving up my personality, becoming the masses. Pretentious I know but whatever. Meds don't do shit. I've had so many appointments with my psychiatrist to change my meds or the dosage but nothing has worked and it's been too long. 

I decided to go into an outpatient program in February. Things were really bad. I started disassociating very intensely. I can't feel my body move, I can't control my motions. It's one of the most terrifying things I've ever experienced. I went through the application process and got accepted into outpatient care. I was finally going to get thorough help. Confidentiality had been broken, relationships irreparable but I was going to do what I needed to do. The day I start I find out my insurance doesn't cover it.

I am so fucking tired of being too poor. I'm tired. It's so fucking humiliating to not be able to take care of yourself because you can't afford it. When I grew up everyone thought I was gonna be the kid to escape this shit. To break the cycle and actually make something of myself and be content. I was smart, I was bilingual and inventive and passionate and I learned about how to best fight my circumstances. I really thought I had a chance. But I don't.

There's no escaping the cycle of poverty. It comes back to bite no matter what you do.  My grades suffered because I didn't have a computer, or internet, or because I was losing my apartment or whatever the crisis might've been at the time. My grades are shit now, like a 1. something gpa. I can't get a scholarship and to be totally fucking honest I'm not sure I'd even graduate high school. I'm a financial drain on all my guardians. My mom won't buy me food, my dad is trying to not lose his other kid, and my grandma (who raised me) is forced to live with my dad and pay off the house because he can't afford it and knew he could leech off of her. I can't work because I'm already failing all my classes and I'm supposed to fix that.

The worst part is being aware of my situation. I can't afford to be healthy. I can't afford to be educated. I can't afford to be happy. How fucked up is that? I don't try and paint myself as the victim of this dumb ass capitalist society but come ON. It doesn't matter how I play the game. It doesn't matter how hard I try and be better. I can't pay for it. If I keep going, then in 10 years I'm gonna be a deadbeat working three jobs in some toxic relationship just like every other adult in my life. 

I can't have a life. I can't pay for it. If I kill myself that's like max a $7000 funeral. I have about a thousand and my family probably wouldn't spend that much anyway. Hell, if I can get rid of the body they won't even have to deal with that. No more food expenses, no more school expenses, no more health expenses. They can sell my shit, rent out my room, i don't care: I'll be fucking dead what do I need all this shit for? I can't keep up. Every time I turn a corner there's some new crisis to be dealt with.

Hell, if I can get rid of the body they won't even have to deal with that. No more food expenses, no more school expenses, no more health expenses. They can sell my shit, rent out my room, i don't care: I'll be fucking dead what do I need all this shit for? I can't keep up. Every time I turn a corner there's some new crisis to be dealt with. I can't keep doing this. Something has got to change and the only thing left to try is killing myself.everything is awful and I can't afford to be alive"

,SuicideWatch,"Ive been going pretty good for some time.  
Got a flat, got a job, stayed clean for an almost year (except cigs and beers why I try limit as much as i can).  
I even had established morning routine before job like exercising and meditations. I were even writing daily journal which helped me a lot with memory and thinking. Exercising proved to be excelent whenever my attention started to go jumpy. I was going to sleep at exact time and woke a exact time same. It wasnt exactly perfect but it was better then before.   


And then i dont know  what happened. Guess its the freaking weather and loneliness along with overthinking that got me back into this moodiness.  
I guess I kind off hoped my father and mother would be freaking proud of me to stop dragging people into the same hole i was in and using.  
that they would be proud i found the job and keep it , that i try  even through i have health complications. But none of it happened. They each have their own families and im just a waste with no one to talk to except for my therapist and girlfriend. And I dont even know how to grateful to at least have someone since they dont understand how I am feeling.  
I just sit home trying to live someones else life inside comics and playing the same game over and over again even through i hate it. Trying to find a way to get away with assisted suicide because I cant do a shit right.  
Most depressing thing I realized is that it doesnt really matter how much i try to change myself. People instenctively hate me. That it doesnt matter if i try to live ""normal"" life. it still sucks. It doesnt matter if am clean or not , since no one cares. Everywhere i go theres this black cloud of my negativity transfering my bad ""mojo"" onto other people. Im burden to my gf since im most of the last month only sad piece of shit that cant do nothing to make this life better. Im burden even to her friends who took a pity on my cause im depressed shit.  
It doesnt even matter if i would die. No one cares a one piece of shit. All gonna be friends till I had money and drugs , they called adn talked about their problems , but now when im down theres no one.  
Im just waiting till dignitas answer me with mail so I can start preparing to leave this shitty hole called reality.   
Ive been trough so much.. Be it Abusive childhood, Abusive ex, Depressions since I was 11, Bullying, Drug addiction , anxieties, agoraphobia, so called ""desilusions"", Fake friends who destroyed any bit of my ability to trust a different human being, Being forced by a girl to almost having sex when i was 6, Constant Isolations ,School failures, being scapegoated, being hospitalised , tried to kill myself 3 times, Being left on my own my whole life with no support from my so called parents who just made everything worse. I cant get over it.   
I keep hearing all those bullshits like ""just change your thinking man"". How the heck am i supposed to change something that has been hardwired into my head for years when i was still a child.  


Id love to make comics, Id love to make music but i cant do anything else except for reading and playing over and over again , cause i have no energy to do anything. Worst part is I can hear laughing all the people I know. And even worse part is I know no one will answer this post again , cause theres just no other way than to ends this miserable piece of shit thats called my life.  
I hate all those people who think Assisted-suicide/Euthanasia shouldnt be avaible to people with mental illness. It is like saying ""people with cancer doesnt deserve to die a calm way.""

,SuicideWatch,"- Chronic pain from TMJ (I can’t even eat, eat mushy or liquid foods), can’t talk or sing much anymore, just lay in bed and sleep to escape pain 

- Chronic sinus infections (I can’t breathe, always feel like I’m about to sneeze, eyes swollen shut half the day)

- I try to be a kind person the best I can. I’ve never yelled at a stranger or friend or boyfriend. I’ve never cheated. I’m not clingy. I support everyone with everything they do, and I give people hundreds of chances to change. I make food for people. If someone has a problem, even a random person who hasn’t been the nicest, I will talk to them and try to give them solutions. I try to put out good karma into this world. I know I won’t be here much longer, so might as well make a positive impact. I try to not be stepped on either though. 

- Chronic inflammation and skin conditions (acne, eczema, every pore on my leg is purple and inflamed, eyelids are always inflamed and crusty and often swollen completely shut, family thinks I exaggerate these symptoms and that I just naturally look swollen and red or whatever)

- Zero friends. Not exaggerating. Not one friend. Never had a close friend before. I’ve had depression ever since I’m 10. I text some people occasionally but no one I’m close to who I can share my feelings or hang out with.

- Was raped. No one acknowledged, and when they did realize, told me to be more picky with my sexual partners. I couldn’t have been more picky. I was passed out.

- Not in school (even though I had a 4.2 GPA and 1550 SAT). Was homeschooled 10-12th grade high school. Went to liberal arts college in another state has manic/psychotic episodes had to go back home. Started community college but parents pulled me out during my depressive episode.

- No trust in men. I can never have a normal relationship. Besides being raped, I had men bombard me with videos of porn stars and detail why I wasn’t as hot as them, inspect me for flaws, take advantage of my past trauma as part of their kink, lie to me about being married, tell me that the only reason they like me is because I’m psycho or dumb, etc. I shouldn’t have been dating during this bad time. During my Klonopin withdrawal period, I had a panic attack and a guy just drove away.

- OCD thoughts nonstop. I’m scared of even thinking certain thoughts. I’m convinced certain thoughts or not having certainty thoughts will jinx my future. I’m scared I’m a sexual deviant (even though I have no libido and am a straight vanilla female with only 2 sexual partners ever 3 including rape). I’m convinced I’m becoming a hermaphrodite, or that I’m actually transgender. Weird thoughts.

- Eating disorder. Scared of being fat, also scared of being skinny. I just want to look ill. I don’t want to look like a girl that men fetishize. Look small and thin and pedophiles will want to rape me. Look curvy and I’ll be objectified. I can’t stop bingeing and purging. I was underweight then a guy was checking me out now I want to become fat.

- Mom harassed me for my nude photos. She imitated how I took the photos, this is what drove me to attempt suicide. She showed them to my dad and sister and now everyone thinks I’m a slut and my sister tells my cousin about how I sleep with many men on the first date. 

- Blatant preferential treatment for my sister. She gets her laptop fixed, I don’t. She gets haircuts, I don’t. While I was getting a seizure from Klonopin withdrawals, my mom was shopping for a custom coat for my sister for hours and when I told my mom what happened she said something like “oh that’s not nice.”

- Hundreds of people know my diagnosis and think I’m crazy. My sister had a fundraiser for mental illness to help her get into a good college and to make it more inspirational she shared my health information with many people who now treat me weird.

,SuicideWatch,"There's this thing that circles around my feed every once in a while, about how Eeyore is feeling low so he stays at his house instead of going out with Pooh and Piglet, so Pooh and Piglet go to his house, where Eeyore says he's not been hanging around with them because he's sad and low and not much fun to be around. So then Pooh and Piglet sit next to Eeyore and don't say anything, they just lend him their presence, with love and without judgment.

So then Pooh and Piglet sit next to Eeyore and don't say anything, they just lend him their presence, with love and without judgment. And then, although he doesn't feel better, he \*does\* feel better.

I've got people like that, people who have straight up offered just to sit with me, who don't care how low I am or how un-fun I am to be with, they just love me.

,SuicideWatch,"Ever since I came to the States for college, I've just been in a depressive state of mind. School killed my passion for what I wanted to do with a shit ton of work and almost no free time to myself. I want to change schools/take a gap year, but I am unable to do that due to financial reasons. I don't have friends in school. I have classmates, but they feel more like coworkers who are just concerned about themselves and their own career, more than friends. My family doesn't feel like a family; it's a nightmare where everyone hates each other. 

I used to be a very optimistic guy with very little pessimism. But now, I feel like my pessimistic side has taken over me. I *think* that there's an inner voice that tells me that I should go ahead and kill myself because it's an easy solution to every single problem I have. I also noticed that I'm not being my original self anymore. I lose patience way faster than I used to, I get upset more easily, and so much more. I feel like I've lost my own self. I don't know who I am anymore. Everything seems pointless and nothing motivates me to work hard and live life anymore.

BUT I know I shouldn't act on suicide. I understand that it's wrong and selfish. And my reasons to suicide are not reasonable AT ALL. I keep telling myself that I'm just in a rough patch of life and it's just a small hill that I'd have to climb over.

Further, my procrastination absolutely fucked me over this semester. I'm going to fail my classes and probably have to retake them. My parents are going to be crazy mad at me, yet I don't care for some reason. My concerns aren't at school, but at life itself.

I don't know what to do. I don't know what I should do. I can't tell if I became a lazy person and now I'm trying to justify my laziness or if this is just my body's response to a lot of stress accumulated over the years.

School killed my passion for what I wanted to do with a shit ton of work and almost no free time to myself.

I have classmates, but they feel more like coworkers who are just concerned about themselves and their own career, more than friends. My family doesn't feel like a family; it's a nightmare where everyone hates each other. 

I used to be a very optimistic guy with very little pessimism. But now, I feel like my pessimistic side has taken over me. I *think* that there's an inner voice that tells me that I should go ahead and kill myself because it's an easy solution to every single problem I have. I also noticed that I'm not being my original self anymore. I lose patience way faster than I used to, I get upset more easily, and so much more. I feel like I've lost my own self.

My parents made me go to engineering school, far from their home in paris, after 3 years of preparatory in maths and physics . I immediatly hated the school, i  did a few entreprise visit with my class and i knew i didnt want to be an engineer. I d rather kill myself than becoming one engislave. I made really good friends in this city tho, even if i wasn't going to school anymore  at one point i was still very happy because of them.

So i told my parents i wanted to stop engineering school, that i wanted to get a job until next year when i will go study something i always dreamt about, becoming a doctor. I went back home for holidays, 3 weeks ago.

I have rough background story with my parents, i'm always in conflict with them and until last summer they always solved conflicts by hitting me or insulting me, saying horrible things that made me hate them. They did make me sleep outside for a few days when i was still a good student in preparatory class, they made me bleed several times, my dad with a sharped stick of wood and my mom with her nails.

I told them i wanted to get a job in the city i was studying, far from home, because i could be near my friends. I told them being home with them was torture, that it was making me go insane and suicidal. I'm still at their home rn, i have a job, but i still want to go live in this city, with my friends and my girlfriend who lives there and to get a job there. Nobody talks to me at home, they took my computer and my credit card. I cant go out, i cant see any friend nearby, i cant do anything or enjoy life. 

They want me stay here, no discussion possible. They make me want to kill myself, they repeating every time i talk about my friends that they don't care about me, that they think i'm a looser and  a piece of shit because i stopped this school.

I am sorry for any error, english not my first language and I'm very anxious right now. It's a long story and it's kind of confusing, but here we go.

I am depressed since ever, I don't know when it started or how it started, the only thing that I know is that I am depressed since I was a kid and things is getting worse and worse. I was in big crisis in the last two years, life was not what I was expecting to be and things are so complicated, I tried, tried and I am still being fucked by things. So my cousin lives in another country and I asked her if I could stay with her for 3 months until things get better and I can organize myself to live here. So I moved here one month ago and I am trying to build things to live here. Maybe another country, another life maybe things get better, I don't know, I am trying.  
When I asked her if I can stay in her home she was really kind and supportive, it was in august/2019. Then I got here last month and she isn't nice at all. She wakes me up on purpose, she says bad things like ""I can watch my tv cause you are sleeping on the couch"" (the couch is ""my bed"" now). She insinuated that I should find a place for me since the day I arrived here. I try the most to help with things, I clean the house, I wash her clothes, I go the supermarket, I buy the food, I cook the food, I try to be outside the most so I give her a space. And still she's acting bad towards me. I don't know what to do since I asked her to be here for 3 months and after one month things are bad like this. The thing is that I feel so lonely right now and then I tried to talk with her yesterday and she was so mean, she say things like ""people are lonely"", ""grow up that life is hard"", ""cut off this depressed shit"" and others things really mean. The she got out and get really really really drunk with her friends and when she got home, she was another person, she was fun, making jokes, making me laugh, we watch a movie together and I was so fucked up with all the shit that I didn't sleep at all this night. Then she wakes up and starting a argument with me cause the dishes are dirty, but it was her, she used this last night when she was drunk, I tried to talk with her and she just said something like ""I hate that you here"". Now I am really confused. I know that I am not the asshole at all, but will I be the asshole if I kill myself now?

,SuicideWatch,"It's not that I hate working but... no, it is precisely that I hate working. I just can't come to terms with the thought that I'm going to waste a huge part of my life doing things I don't like to do. 
For what? I don't see the point on working hard and achieving all these career goals if the only time I'm going to have to myself would be after I retire — IF I'm ever going to retire and not just drop dead in my 50/60s. 
I'm 27 and I have no idea how to live this life, my supposedly only chance at sentience. I'm depressed due to a lot of things: physical health problems, not being able to find a job that I'm going to at least tolerate, feeling generally lost in life.

,SuicideWatch," 

I had an open cosmetic rhinoplasty 4 months ago and since then I've been experiencing symptoms that have been fairly debilitating for me. A few weeks post-op I noticed that my air flow was different in each nostril and there was a slight pain in my left but I chalked it up to swelling.  

Now, 4 months later there is no more pain but I feel like there is a blockage in my left nostril and I can't sense airflow at all in either nostril which is keeping me up at night.  

I'm on sleeping pills which is barely helping me get a few hours throughout the night. I'm really scared and did not expect to go through this scary journey - all I wanted was a refinement. How would I know if I have empty nose syndrome or if I should wait longer to see if my issues are resolved naturally?

,SuicideWatch,"Failing half my classes, same as last semester, going to drop out of college at the end of the semester with no life direction, no ambition, no motivation, no desires, dreams, will to live. I don’t know how I’m going to hide the scars covering my arm during the summer when it’s 100 fucking degrees out. I’ve worn short sleeve shirts my whole life almost never wearing long sleeves (not counting hoodies/coats/etc) so I’ll definitely receive lots of questions if I’m sweating my ass off wearing a long sleeve shirt for no reason during hot summer days. 

Don’t really see a way out of this shitty life other than killing myself. Mom asked me a couple weeks ago where I see myself in 10 years. I told her I didn’t know, but all I could think was that I don’t see any scenario where I’m alive in 10 years. Might as well just off myself now before everything goes to shit... sorry... before everything gets even shittier just like it always does.

TW: drug use

September 9th Of 2018 was the worst day of my life, on that day my father had passed away unexpectedly from a blood clot in his lung that the doctors knew about but never put him on medication for. That day, my entire life had changed and since then I haven’t been able to recover. While yes I was depressed much before this and had been struggling with suicidal thoughts and tendencies since I was 8, my father death had made it all so much worse. I had started to get on anti-depressants, get counseling, and come out to my mother as trans not long after this because she had discovered I was trans. None of these treatments helped much until late November after I had attempted suicide and realized how cared for I was by family that had visited me in the hospital, then I really started to work hard for them to get better and to make sure I could get to the day when I could start hormone replacement therapy in about a year. Not long after that incident I traveled to New Mexico to visit family and my mom fell in love with a hole here and felt the need to reconnect with the family that lived there so she had decided to buy a home here and make my family move, which I can’t fully blame her for wanting to get out of the state we lived in (ny), it reminded her too much of my dad. When I first heard this news I was depressed about it but slowly become more accepting as I got much happier and healthier. I got to a point where I no longer felt the need for medication and cut back on therapy before moving to New Mexico, but those months of hard work all crashed when I got here. When I moved I had honestly lost everything I had known and have been stuck with a family of alcoholics who always start stupid drama over small things. I feel as if I can’t even do anything without someone starting shit about something I’ve done when I’m around them. But anyways soon enough I start school, I’m fairly excited about it but quickly that excitement dies out and is replaced with absolute misery. The school I currently go to refuses to let me use the mens bathroom and makes me use the women’s one because of my biological sex, keeps all of my accounts and name on the attendance as my birth name despite the fact I don’t identify with it, and dress coded me for piercings and dyed hair which they had never mentioned would be a problem when I went to register for the school not even a week before the school year started. So on my first day I get dress coded for things I was never warned about and told I had signed a paper that states I fully read through the dress code and agreed to comply with it (which I had actually gotten two weeks later during school hours). Bullshit, right? Well it gets worse. The only kid willing to talk to me was a drug addict who had done cocaine in front of me and offered me some, while high he almost choked himself to death and chucked a desk at the girls in front of us which was quite fucking terrifying. Almost a month after this event the same kid breaks my pencil sharpener and takes the blade part out of it, leaving the class shortly after to go to the bathroom. Of course I tell the teacher and she gets the counselor to get him, and he gets sent to a mental hospital for a week or so and transfers schools. So while yes, he may have been an absolute crackhead he was still the only friend I had so I was very bummed out and felt alone. Months pass and I feel more and more depressed as days go by, I start contemplating suicide once again and try to get my mom to get me a therapist (which she still hasn’t done). And of course on top of all of this kids at school find out I’m transgender and I’ve been getting dead named, picked on, and asked extremely personal questions  since then. Because of this discovery made by my classmates I’ve started to also gotten rape threats and death threats in which I feel there’s no point in reporting since the school cannot even comply by the laws and let me use the bathroom I feel comfortable in. Well I have started to make friends I still feel all alone and hopeless for things to get any better for my life, I’ve been trying so hard to get my life back into shape and actually gave loving here my best shot but I’ve failed myself and been failed by so many others, I see no point in continuing on since things keep getting worse and I’m not sure if I can hold on that much longer. The only reason I’m still here is because I know there’s people that care and I don’t want to put them through the same pain I went through when I lost my dad.",t2_5uz3b057,False,,0,False,My entire life has hit the reset button and I’ve entirely given up hope,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,False,t3_fe9qvi,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583506607.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is quite the long story but i just needed to vent. &lt;/p&gt;

TW: drug use

September 9th Of 2018 was the worst day of my life, on that day my father had passed away unexpectedly from a blood clot in his lung that the doctors knew about but never put him on medication for. That day, my entire life had changed and since then I haven’t been able to recover. While yes I was depressed much before this and had been struggling with suicidal thoughts and tendencies since I was 8, my father death had made it all so much worse. I had started to get on anti-depressants, get counseling, and come out to my mother as trans not long after this because she had discovered I was trans. None of these treatments helped much until late November after I had attempted suicide and realized how cared for I was by family that had visited me in the hospital, then I really started to work hard for them to get better and to make sure I could get to the day when I could start hormone replacement therapy in about a year. Not long after that incident I traveled to New Mexico to visit family and my mom fell in love with a hole here and felt the need to reconnect with the family that lived there so she had decided to buy a home here and make my family move, which I can’t fully blame her for wanting to get out of the state we lived in (ny), it reminded her too much of my dad. When I first heard this news I was depressed about it but slowly become more accepting as I got much happier and healthier. I got to a point where I no longer felt the need for medication and cut back on therapy before moving to New Mexico, but those months of hard work all crashed when I got here. When I moved I had honestly lost everything I had known and have been stuck with a family of alcoholics who always start stupid drama over small things.

Whether we were manipulated, tricked, forced, brutalized, lied to, used and discarded... all of these actions cut deep, to the very core of our being, and it feels like there's no way to ever move past them. When there's nothing else to distract us, the weight is unbearable.How many of us are here because of sexual abuse?"

,SuicideWatch,"She was yelling at me about school stuff in the car. I usually stay calm and let her get it out of her system but today I snapped and told her that I’m suicidal, hoping that she’d calm down. She did not. She belittled me for it while I tried to keep myself from crying too much. I tried again, telling her that I want to kill myself and asking if that’s what she wants. Her immediate response was “You know what? Do what you fucking want.” 

I’m so tired. I’m sixteen, this isn’t normal. I defend her at every turn, even now in group chats with friends calling her abusive while I’m sleeping over at a friend’s house because the thought of returning home makes me feel like I’m gonna puke. 
I had a vivid image of my dead body covered in blood with a note saying that line of hers and a smiley face. I also want to see the look on her face when I walk up to her with a knife in my hand and tear my wrists open. I want to damage her as much as she’s damaged me. 

I’m not as depressed as I normally am, surprisingly. Just tired. She came by with a bag of extra clothes for me and I think she found an empty pack of cigarettes in my closet because she took a shirt of mine that was under it (I hide it between layers). My friend went out to get it for me because thinking about talking to her face to face made me anxious. She blamed him, to his face, for me wanting to switch schools; that he scared me out of my current program. 

I’m not actually going to kill myself or anything, as much as I want to. It’s too short notice for me to make any final preparations. But I think if I hadn’t called my friend I’d have broken my self harm clean streak and cut down to the dermis again or maybe even deeper. 

The icing on the cake for all this is that I got called selfish by my mom for not coming home. Her boyfriend’s mother passed away recently (we live with him) and her funeral is tomorrow. I have selfish timing apparently, and I’m not even the one who started this whole thing in the first place. I’ve cried so much that I don’t feel any strong emotions anymore. All I have right now is sadness, but it almost fades into me being tired. 

I also have guilt. Not because of this but because I have an important group project due tomorrow and I was supposed to make a poster. I obviously wasn’t able to complete it. People’s grades are going to suffer because I’m too weak to just walk inside the appartment and sit through some yelling     

I just don’t deserve to live, I guess. I’m a massive letdown to everyone in one way or another. People would be much happier with me gone, my parents are divorced and though my dad would be upset about losing me at least he won’t have to put up with my melodrama anymore. My mom won’t have to stress herself out over me being too tired to put effort into school, there wouldn’t be any strain on her relationship with her boyfriend anymore because of me. My classmates won’t have to worry about bad grades because of a flakey group member. My boyfriend can get someone who won’t ruin his mood all the time just by talking about their feelings. My family doesn’t have to worry about me being a disgrace or anything, if a member dies by suicide they’ll likely just get pity rather than dirty looks after I inevitably become a junkie. 

The only one I would really feel bad for is my dog. I don’t see him often, every few months or so. But he loves me about as much as I love him. I don’t know how I could ever explain to him, in a way that he’ll understand, why I’m leaving and not coming back. Why it’s not his fault, the extent of how much I love him, how good of a boy he is. That’s just something I’ll never be able to do for him. 

Vent over. I need to get some sleep but I don’t think I’ll be able to get up in the morning.

&lt;p&gt;I also have guilt. Not because of this but because I have an important group project due tomorrow and I was supposed to make a poster. I obviously wasn’t able to complete it. People’s grades are going to suffer because I’m too weak to just walk inside the appartment and sit through some yelling     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don’t deserve to live, I guess. I’m a massive letdown to everyone in one way or another. People would be much happier with me gone, my parents are divorced and though my dad would be upset about losing me at least he won’t have to put up with my melodrama anymore. My mom won’t have to stress herself out over me being too tired to put effort into school, there wouldn’t be any strain on her relationship with her boyfriend anymore because of me. My classmates won’t have to worry about bad grades because of a flakey group member. My boyfriend can get someone who won’t ruin his mood all the time just by talking about their feelings. My family doesn’t have to worry about me being a disgrace or anything, if a member dies by suicide they’ll likely just get pity rather than dirty looks after I inevitably become a junkie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only one I would really feel bad for is my dog. I don’t see him often, every few months or so. But he loves me about as much as I love him. I don’t know how I could ever explain to him, in a way that he’ll understand, why I’m leaving and not coming back. Why it’s not his fault, the extent of how much I love him, how good of a boy he is. That’s just something I’ll never be able to do for him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vent over. I need to get some sleep but I don’t think I’ll be able to get up in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s any consolation, to those that have read this far, I’m seeing my psychologist tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

I usually stay calm and let her get it out of her system but today I snapped and told her that I’m suicidal, hoping that she’d calm down. She did not. She belittled me for it while I tried to keep myself from crying too much. I tried again, telling her that I want to kill myself and asking if that’s what she wants. Her immediate response was “You know what? Do what you fucking want.” 

I’m so tired. I’m sixteen, this isn’t normal. I defend her at every turn, even now in group chats with friends calling her abusive while I’m sleeping over at a friend’s house because the thought of returning home makes me feel like I’m gonna puke. 
I had a vivid image of my dead body covered in blood with a note saying that line of hers and a smiley face. I also want to see the look on her face when I walk up to her with a knife in my hand and tear my wrists open. I want to damage her as much as she’s damaged me. 

I’m not as depressed as I normally am, surprisingly. Just tired. She came by with a bag of extra clothes for me and I think she found an empty pack of cigarettes in my closet because she took a shirt of mine that was under it (I hide it between layers). My friend went out to get it for me because thinking about talking to her face to face made me anxious. She blamed him, to his face, for me wanting to switch schools; that he scared me out of my current program. 

I’m not actually going to kill myself or anything, as much as I want to. It’s too short notice for me to make any final preparations. But I think if I hadn’t called my friend I’d have broken my self harm clean streak and cut down to the dermis again or maybe even deeper. 

The icing on the cake for all this is that I got called selfish by my mom for not coming home. Her boyfriend’s mother passed away recently (we live with him) and her funeral is tomorrow.

,SuicideWatch,"The summer of 2019 I started developing severe OCD after suffering from mild, unnoticeable OCD for many years. I just feel so tired of things, so bored of living, but I can't commit suicide.

I know that there are people who care about about me, like my parents, and the shit they would have to go trough if I commited suicide is unbearable for me to imagine.

,SuicideWatch,"I think about suicide most days. When I visit my 92yr old grandmother in her care home I wish I could be there, waiting to die - how peaceful it must be to know you will be released from all this suffering very soon? 

I consider myself a spiritual person and have been heavily into yoga, meditation and psychedelics and learnt about Buddhist philosophy which is what has formed my beliefs about death. Most people find this a healing path but for me the transcendental experiences I have had have felt like such a homecoming that I haven’t wanted to return to reality. I have never felt at home in myself and often feel like I desperately want to “get out of my body” in which I feel trapped. I have always felt I was born into the wrong body/life. I’ve also believed from a young age that I will die from suicide or a reckless accident. I unsuccessfully attempted age 25 and have had some other near misses. 

The thing I am struggling with is I believe that if I kill myself my soul will return back to the source but I am worried it will be turned around and put right back into another life of equal amount of suffering to mine as my soul won’t have evolved at all. I don’t think I can escape it unless I evolve by overcoming my struggles. I’ve had an eating disorder for 17yrs, as well as BPD and Bipolar. I guess this is the cycle of Samsara and the continual dukkha/suffering which is part of the human condition. 

When I think about this it makes me feel trapped and is going some way to put me off the idea of suicide, but at the same time I feel like I’ve exhausted my energy to try and overcome it all in this life - I’m exhausted in my battle against this ED, it feels completely hopeless.

I finally opened up to my wife about these thoughts a year ago and she blamed me for how that made her feel knowing I want to kill myself. She left me some short time after. Since then I've had about 6 months of time to really digest my thoughts and feeling. I feel an incredible depression each day and then feel even worse when I think about my children having to deal with my death. For a long time that deterred me from suicide, now it seems more like a valid solution to my pain and a way for everyone to move on. I dont want anyone to find my body which clearly describes suicide. On the contrary I'd like to frame my death so the narrative suggests a noble death and therefore easier on my family. Of course my children love me, but it's been an incredibly long time since I've felt love or purpose. I feel like a paycheck, a slave to everyone else's needs, a pawn in someone else's game. I'm happy that I experienced love, excitement, danger, success but I feel now at the age of 35 the good days of ignorant bliss are behind me. Anyway, just figured I'd put this out here, to people that wouldn't tell me how selfish I am, or how this doesnt help anyone. I just want the pain to end.I think its time"

,SuicideWatch,"I generally steer clear of making posts of this nature since I don't like discussing my personal life on social media. That said, this is something that I feel I must be open about in order to come to terms with it. To contextualise, I'm a 16 year old girl and I'm originally from Eastern Europe, but I now live in the UK. This may be a very long read and I'll be sure to TL;DR.

I was diagnosed with autism at the age of 4. I'm not 'low functioning' (for lack of a better term; feel free to suggest one) per se, but to other people, it's pretty obvious that I am developmentally disabled. I have poor fine motor skills, struggle to articulate my thoughts and am extremely susceptible to meltdowns when not on birth control (I'll explain this later).

For most of my early childhood this was largely not a huge issue in my life. I received good support and people were usually empathetic towards my struggles. However, things started to go slowly and then eventually very dramatically downhill once I got my period age 10.

My parents noticed that I had menstrual cycles that were on average around 21 days in length. Initially, they weren't too worried and assumed they would eventually become more regular as time went on. They didn't. They became shorter, and when I last calculated them, my cycles lasted 18 days on average. This messed up my hormones and I became extremely depressed. This depression peaked around my period. I don't mean that I got typical premenstrual symptoms; in the days leading up to my period, I would self harm, have suicidal thoughts, experience very violent and dramatic mood swings, become extremely sensitive to sound and texture and lose interest in my hobbies and friends. I suggested possibly having PMDD but this idea was dismissed by my parents and doctors.

I first attempted suicide when I was either 13 or 14 (but definitely no older). I didn't inform my parents of this, but only because I didn't want to upset them or make them feel like they had failed me as parents, because they definitely didn't. I then attempted once more aged 15.

During this time period I was prescribed the combined oral contraceptive pill. Theoretically, I am supposed to 'tricycle' them, or in other words, take three months' worth of packs and then take a break. I did this until the second most recent attempt in October of last year. This was the first one that I told anybody about and you may not be shocked to hear that it happened whilst I was on a 'period break'. I went to A&amp;E the next day, where I waited for seven hours before being seen by a therapist for twenty minutes who told me that I seemed to have things 'under control' and took no action except refer me to another therapist, who I had one appointment with where I heard the same thing. It was my mother's birthday that day and I have not forgiven myself for making her spend it in A&amp;E. She stayed mostly collected throughout it all but I could tell she felt very upset and shaken. Since this, I have stopped taking breaks and now do not have periods at all. This is massively helpful but my situation is still not great.

It's partly for that reason that I didn't inform her of my most recent attempt in December. It was also because I was due to fly to Canada the day after the attempt and couldn't bring myself to jeopardise the trip. I considered calling a suicide hotline once I was in Montreal but ended up not doing it, mainly because when I looked up numbers to call, I couldn't find one in Quebec that offered English counselling, but also because my mother discouraged it because of what we would be charged (please remember, she didn't know that I had attempted suicide).

I'm in Year 11, which in the UK is the final year of high school. I'm currently caught up in revising for my GCSEs, which I'm doing OK with from an academic perspective, but struggling to cope with mentally. I'm also being bullied; less than in previous years but still in a way that fucks me up even though I pretend it doesn't. I used to be targeted for my personality and mannerisms, which I've given up being upset about since I've accepted that I don't carry myself typically. Recently, though, they've shifted to targeting my appearance.

This may make me sound shallow, but as a 16 year old girl, having my appearance mocked and scorned is completely crushing. A few months ago it was never something I gave much thought and I never felt insecure about my appearance outside of typical concerns teenage girls have. People call me 'ugly' and laugh at me to my face. I've never been in a relationship of any kind and, at the risk of sounding like an incel, this does not give me hope for the future and makes me question if I am physically attractive to anybody. It makes me feel arrogant for having ever thought that there was nothing wrong with the way I look. And I'm starting to spiral emotionally because of it. 15 year old me would have laughed at the idea of me being so insecure about my physical appearance, but for me, it was one of the few things I had genuine confidence and pride in and now it is being taken from me.

I feel very shallow and fragile for feeling this way. I'm 16 and have four attempts to my name and it's embarrassing. I hate that I'll never really be able to disassociate myself from that because this isn't what I want to look back on in 10 or 20 years time.

&lt;p&gt;For most of my early childhood this was largely not a huge issue in my life. I received good support and people were usually empathetic towards my struggles. However, things started to go slowly and then eventually very dramatically downhill once I got my period age 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents noticed that I had menstrual cycles that were on average around 21 days in length. Initially, they weren&amp;#39;t too worried and assumed they would eventually become more regular as time went on. They didn&amp;#39;t. They became shorter, and when I last calculated them, my cycles lasted 18 days on average. This messed up my hormones and I became extremely depressed. This depression peaked around my period. I don&amp;#39;t mean that I got typical premenstrual symptoms; in the days leading up to my period, I would self harm, have suicidal thoughts, experience very violent and dramatic mood swings, become extremely sensitive to sound and texture and lose interest in my hobbies and friends. I suggested possibly having PMDD but this idea was dismissed by my parents and doctors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first attempted suicide when I was either 13 or 14 (but definitely no older). I didn&amp;#39;t inform my parents of this, but only because I didn&amp;#39;t want to upset them or make them feel like they had failed me as parents, because they definitely didn&amp;#39;t. I then attempted once more aged 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time period I was prescribed the combined oral contraceptive pill. Theoretically, I am supposed to &amp;#39;tricycle&amp;#39; them, or in other words, take three months&amp;#39; worth of packs and then take a break. I did this until the second most recent attempt in October of last year. This was the first one that I told anybody about and you may not be shocked to hear that it happened whilst I was on a &amp;#39;period break&amp;#39;. I went to A&amp;amp;E the next day, where I waited for seven hours before being seen by a therapist for twenty minutes who told me that I seemed to have things &amp;#39;under control&amp;#39; and took no action except refer me to another therapist, who I had one appointment with where I heard the same thing. It was my mother&amp;#39;s birthday that day and I have not forgiven myself for making her spend it in A&amp;amp;E. She stayed mostly collected throughout it all but I could tell she felt very upset and shaken. Since this, I have stopped taking breaks and now do not have periods at all. This is massively helpful but my situation is still not great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s partly for that reason that I didn&amp;#39;t inform her of my most recent attempt in December. It was also because I was due to fly to Canada the day after the attempt and couldn&amp;#39;t bring myself to jeopardise the trip. I considered calling a suicide hotline once I was in Montreal but ended up not doing it, mainly because when I looked up numbers to call, I couldn&amp;#39;t find one in Quebec that offered English counselling, but also because my mother discouraged it because of what we would be charged (please remember, she didn&amp;#39;t know that I had attempted suicide).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in Year 11, which in the UK is the final year of high school. I&amp;#39;m currently caught up in revising for my GCSEs, which I&amp;#39;m doing OK with from an academic perspective, but struggling to cope with mentally. I&amp;#39;m also being bullied; less than in previous years but still in a way that fucks me up even though I pretend it doesn&amp;#39;t. I used to be targeted for my personality and mannerisms, which I&amp;#39;ve given up being upset about since I&amp;#39;ve accepted that I don&amp;#39;t carry myself typically. Recently, though, they&amp;#39;ve shifted to targeting my appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may make me sound shallow, but as a 16 year old girl, having my appearance mocked and scorned is completely crushing. A few months ago it was never something I gave much thought and I never felt insecure about my appearance outside of typical concerns teenage girls have. People call me &amp;#39;ugly&amp;#39; and laugh at me to my face. I&amp;#39;ve never been in a relationship of any kind and, at the risk of sounding like an incel, this does not give me hope for the future and makes me question if I am physically attractive to anybody. It makes me feel arrogant for having ever thought that there was nothing wrong with the way I look. And I&amp;#39;m starting to spiral emotionally because of it. 15 year old me would have laughed at the idea of me being so insecure about my physical appearance, but for me, it was one of the few things I had genuine confidence and pride in and now it is being taken from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel very shallow and fragile for feeling this way. I&amp;#39;m 16 and have four attempts to my name and it&amp;#39;s embarrassing. I hate that I&amp;#39;ll never really be able to disassociate myself from that because this isn&amp;#39;t what I want to look back on in 10 or 20 years time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I&amp;#39;m a 16 year old autistic girl who has attempted suicide 4 times and is now reconsidering due to bullying concerning my physical appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello everyone here :) 
I’m a 16 year old female. I’m not feeling too well right now. I’m getting these thoughts and suicidal feeling again. They come back occasionally. Right now, I’m eating with my beautiful mother, laughing with my dad as he says my mother is a wonderful cook. I broke down last night when I finished reviewing and studying from my classes. I studied hard for a test I had today, and I felt good about it! Right now, I’m eating as I type this. This day? I thought it would be bad, but it was okay, turning to bad. I’m In a relationship. I love this boy so much. I’ve been happiest with him since years ago. Im a sophomore in high school by the way. I’ve trusted my boyfriend so much and he’s always been there for me. Today however, I felt something was wrong. He didn’t really speak with me. But it’s okay, I’m probably just overthinking it, I want nothing but pure happiness for him. Whether he finds it with someone else or me. I’ve always helped others, always had a smile on my face and I’ve always wanted nothing but happiness for everyone. I’ve only want happiness for everyone else. I want them to feel good and appreciated by atleast someone when they do something. I’ve always supported through anything and I’ve never judged. I’ve been kind to everyone. I appreciate everything that’s given to me, but it’s been a few months I’ve been feeling these usual suicide thoughts. They come often. It’s been a year since I’ve been like this, trying to hang on and move on from it. Whether I see happy moments, times where I love this view. Or others where I’m not sure how I’m feeling.

I felt pressured by my mother. Verbally. I hate trying so hard at school, and failing. What’s the point? I’m going to fail anyways. I’ve always done my best in everything and I’ve always tried to stay happy and look the positive way. But I can’t anymore. I’ve always thought, what if I can just end it? Would anyone really miss me? I think about it, imagining my parents. But, would I really make a difference? Will I go to hell? Religiously talking, I love god. But I’m sorry, I feel like I’ve lost faith in myself. I don’t see it anymore. And every night, I pray, to have a good day, to see my parents, my friends. To stay safe. I want to die, but I don’t. But I want to attempt, but I’m afraid. What if I fail? Would my family be ashamed? 

I think about it daily, and I feel like the only reason I’m
here is for my love. To be there for him when he needs company, to be there for him when he can’t find the light, to be with him when he can’t be happy. To support him through the good and bad. No matter what, no matter the past. For my dad, who’s worked really hard every single night for me and my family. For my friend, who needs support from his friends and family. For my dog, who always listened to me when I felt alone, knowing he wouldn’t understand, but knows I’m upset and let’s me cry on him when I don’t have anyone else.

The intent to kill myself is very strong and it reaches the point that it creates a heavy feeling in my brain and renders my progress with my mental health null. I am quite aware of the progress I made the past few months and I have even considered myself depression-free until I had an episode after feeling very stable for three weeks. I realized that depression isn't a one-time thing that can be cured with constant means of pharmacology.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm a 53 year old man and my life has sucked on so many levels. I've been married and divorced 3 times and several LTRs over the years, including the one I'm in now (over a year and we live together). I've got 5 kids, one just turned 13 last week. She wants nothing to do with me, nor does 2 of her half-sisters, who aren't even nearby (I called DFCS after we split because there were (literally hundreds) of roaches in the apartment in which we lived and she would so nothing about, among other things (like the time her autistic son found her loaded, insecure handgun), but those details are just stuff since I'm now a pariah. 100% would call again. So anyway, no contact with the youngest 3.

But what I'm really struggling with is, ""Why not?""

I know all of the typical reasons involving everyone else, that they'll be hurt, it will affect them horribly, etc. But what about me? Why not? My girlfriend really doesn't like me tbh. (she said I'm the rudest person she's ever met and I believe she means it, even though I've never been told that I was a rude person in 50 years.

But for me, aside from how it affects others, why the hell not? I have no religious faith, because I just don't. If you take away how it affects others, I just don't see a reason to keep living anymore. My job sucks, my girlfriend doesn't even really like me apparently, and I see my parents once a year for 2 days or so and my only brother I haven't seen in 7 tmyears even though we get along.

My hearing sucks, I'm constantly having to ask people to repeat themselves and that frustrates all involved. And even when I don't, I have really loud tinnitus. Neuropathy, ADHD, constant joint pain (not debilitating but always there), frequent memory loss (my gf had to show me pictures of our 3rd date at a steak place because I didn't remember it all and that's not uncommon).

So, why? My current relationship is probably ending soon anyway. For me, what's the point? I don't want to hear about how it affects others because that just adds more guilt to what's already been a pretty shitty life and kinda makes me want to stop that guilt too because I wouldn't have to feel it. I know it's selfish and suicide is indeed probably the most selfish thing I can do. I get that.

But why oh why should *I* want to keep on living when my whole adult life has been a cycle of misery and promises to be more of the same.

I know I shouldn't, right? In my head. But my heart just wants it all to be just over.

,SuicideWatch,"Hey. After much meditation, I decided to create this post, both as therapy for myself and to open up a forum of conversation. I am writing this right before I go to work, so I will probably edit it later. So here it goes. I apologize in advance for my rambling. 

I am currently 20 years old and a sophomore  in college. A few minutes ago I typed in “I’m eventually going to kill myself” into google trying to find some forum post to read. Lo and behold an r/suicidewatch post came up from 3 years ago, which led to me creating my reddit account to make this post.

Throughout my life so far, I have struggled from a crippling loneliness. I was mostly a loner in middle school and high school, one of those arrogant assholes who only care about grades, etc. Inside, however, I had a crippling insecurity about my body image. I have a distinct memory from when I was perhaps 10-11 of staring into the mirror and looking at my face, critiquing every last bit. To those I know, this would not make much sense as I have always been told that I am very attractive. I have never seen it, however. My phone, to this day, is filled with photos that I have taken of myself. 

Deep down, I think that my depression is mostly of a natural physiological basis. Up until I was 18 I had never even held a girl’s hand and up to now I have only kissed one (a very pretty Italian girl who left the country soon after). I have spent most of the last 2 years listening to sad songs, driving aimlessly, chain smoking, and watching movies like Her and Manchester by the Sea. Luckily enough, I do have a best friend that I met in HS who struggles with depression as well. He however, has no problem picking up girls do to his charisma that he has developed over the years as a coping mechanism. Together, we mostly drink, smoke weed, and watch “films.” I always make it a point to get drunk or high enough that my entire life, past and future, flashes before me in a sort of slideshow. 

As I write this, I have been using steroids on and off for 2.5 years. I first started after losing 25 pounds (mostly by starving myself) and then developing an ok physique. I thought that nothing else would make me attractive so I made the decision to buy Testosterone Enanthate off the darknet when I was 17. I didn’t give a shit if I died because, in my mind, there was no other way to find a girl to fill the void inside of me. Now, I am very muscular (5’10’’, 190, around 10% bf), yet my void is not filled and I don’t think it ever will be. 
I am on a solid trajectory right now and will inherit a large sum from my grandfather when I turn 25. This adds no meaning to my life, however. I see myself as a sort of Holden Caulfield or Amory Blaine (from this side of paradise). All I want to do is help people and be loved, but I have a crippling fear that I will only feel loved vicariously, by watching movies and reading books. I can’t shake the feeling that I won’t make it past 40 before I eventually kill myself. My father is currently slowly dying of alcoholism from his depression at 50 just as his father did.

Every time I think of this I am taken back to a memory from when I was a senior in HS. I had been talking to a girl for a month or two and my best friend had hid the fact that he was having sex with her. I had never felt so inadequate in my life. I drove home crying and tied my belt around the doorknob and leaned forward. Thankfully I didn’t follow through with it. This inadequacy still consumes me.

**Don't read if you are easily triggered. I don't want any of you feel bad/worse.**

Okay, some of you already start typing reasons to stay alive. Y'all are so kind for doing that. I miss kind people. Everyone leaves me 'cuz I'm depressed. And everytime I'm in my deepest point of a 'depression wave', somebody dies. Like life also tries to convince me I should kill myself.

So I heard in August I could go to a mental hospital in MARCH. So at that point it sounded so far away that I gave up and neglected myself. Cuz everyday was hell. And I was supposed to wait 6 months. **But** of course I was thankfull my psychiatrist got me on the list of the mental hospital that is specialised in autism. So I was too scared to really tell I wouldn't survive until then.

I've been severe depressed in october. Didn't really come out of my room except for diner or to go to the toilet. Selfharmed the whole day long, slept when I was tired, not on a certain time so my sleep rythm was ruined. Gained weight. Couldn't concentrate on anything. Like I was in my mind already fading away. I became sure life was giving my signs that I should die. Everything that could go wrong, DID go wrong. And in my deepest point, my grandma died. I still haven't accept it. Her death didn't feel real for days. It was on the funeral where it felt like life punched me in the head. The amount of emotions were so much that I tried to not be in the reality anymore. Thinking about an alternate life. Writing stories and imagining me in it constantly.

I think that last thing gave me a depersonalisation disorder or something. I don't know how it works and I know I can't diagnose myself. But on moments where I have a lot of emotions or when I'm a little stressed, I feel like I'm watching my body experiencing things. Like I'm the coördinator in my head watching through my eyes. I can't really talk or think cuz I feel like my body should talk or think in that situation. I'm just watching what happens and take decisions.

And then late October... I was standing on the edge of the bridge and decided to talk to an old friend, instead of jumping at that moment. (She has DID, and one of her personalities is an agressive one who made me dissociate when she wanted me to kms). You can say she's a bad influence, but she's the only one still standing by me and the only one with the same kind of humor. She has help so the thing that happened last year won't happen again.

Anyway, I became a little happier, started enjoying going outside again. I made friends in a therian community cuz I figured back in August I was a therian too. (whatever your opinion is about 'therians', pls dont post them here cuz this isnt what the post is about)

Idk why, but I knew I was going into a depressed moment again, as I was irritated everyday and selfharming again.... So I landed in the depressed wave again. Or should I say drowning? I don't enjoy anything, every food tastes boring. I can't sleep cuz I cry every damn night. I'm constantly thinking about kms. I'm even trying it, or sort of searching boundaries. Taking pills but just enough to still stay alive. Or standing on the edge of the bridge but not jump.

What triggered my to write this post, was because I heard a cat of mine has cancer and he may not survive another week. The cat that shoved his fur in my face :') so I got a little distracted in a traumatising situation which happened 2/3 years ago. (Can't talk about it now cuz PTSD flashbacks will kill me with this amount of emotions I have now) The cat that walks over my legs, jumps in my neck and demands attention when I'm crying on the floor in the middle of the night. He is like my ESA (not official one) And I'm about to lose him. I can't go through this. I can't lose the last string of the rope that I'm holding on the edge of a ravine. I feel like kms at the moment. I don't wanna die. I wanna be of this pain.

About the mental hospital in march? 18 days until an apointment to talk about practical stuff. then I have to wait another week (I guess?) to finally be there and be save from myself.

But plz give me some strenght, some advice. I know I need to hold on these last weeks, but I can't. Every minute of everyday is torture.

Like I&amp;#39;m the coördinator in my head watching through my eyes. I can&amp;#39;t really talk or think cuz I feel like my body should talk or think in that situation. I&amp;#39;m just watching what happens and take decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then late October... I was standing on the edge of the bridge and decided to talk to an old friend, instead of jumping at that moment. (She has DID, and one of her personalities is an agressive one who made me dissociate when she wanted me to kms). You can say she&amp;#39;s a bad influence, but she&amp;#39;s the only one still standing by me and the only one with the same kind of humor. She has help so the thing that happened last year won&amp;#39;t happen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I became a little happier, started enjoying going outside again. I made friends in a therian community cuz I figured back in August I was a therian too. (whatever your opinion is about &amp;#39;therians&amp;#39;, pls dont post them here cuz this isnt what the post is about)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idk why, but I knew I was going into a depressed moment again, as I was irritated everyday and selfharming again.... So I landed in the depressed wave again. Or should I say drowning? I don&amp;#39;t enjoy anything, every food tastes boring. I can&amp;#39;t sleep cuz I cry every damn night. I&amp;#39;m constantly thinking about kms.

&lt;p&gt;What triggered my to write this post, was because I heard a cat of mine has cancer and he may not survive another week. The cat that shoved his fur in my face :&amp;#39;) so I got a little distracted in a traumatising situation which happened 2/3 years ago. (Can&amp;#39;t talk about it now cuz PTSD flashbacks will kill me with this amount of emotions I have now) The cat that walks over my legs, jumps in my neck and demands attention when I&amp;#39;m crying on the floor in the middle of the night. He is like my ESA (not official one) And I&amp;#39;m about to lose him. I can&amp;#39;t go through this. I can&amp;#39;t lose the last string of the rope that I&amp;#39;m holding on the edge of a ravine. I feel like kms at the moment. I don&amp;#39;t wanna die. I wanna be of this pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the mental hospital in march? 18 days until an apointment to talk about practical stuff. then I have to wait another week (I guess?) to finally be there and be save from myself.&lt;/p&gt;

**Don't read if you are easily triggered. I don't want any of you feel bad/worse.**

Okay, some of you already start typing reasons to stay alive. Y'all are so kind for doing that. I miss kind people. Everyone leaves me 'cuz I'm depressed. And everytime I'm in my deepest point of a 'depression wave', somebody dies. Like life also tries to convince me I should kill myself.

So I heard in August I could go to a mental hospital in MARCH. So at that point it sounded so far away that I gave up and neglected myself. Cuz everyday was hell. And I was supposed to wait 6 months. **But** of course I was thankfull my psychiatrist got me on the list of the mental hospital that is specialised in autism. So I was too scared to really tell I wouldn't survive until then.

I've been severe depressed in october. Didn't really come out of my room except for diner or to go to the toilet. Selfharmed the whole day long, slept when I was tired, not on a certain time so my sleep rythm was ruined. Gained weight. Couldn't concentrate on anything. Like I was in my mind already fading away. I became sure life was giving my signs that I should die. Everything that could go wrong, DID go wrong. And in my deepest point, my grandma died. I still haven't accept it. Her death didn't feel real for days. It was on the funeral where it felt like life punched me in the head. The amount of emotions were so much that I tried to not be in the reality anymore. Thinking about an alternate life. Writing stories and imagining me in it constantly.

I think that last thing gave me a depersonalisation disorder or something. I don't know how it works and I know I can't diagnose myself. But on moments where I have a lot of emotions or when I'm a little stressed, I feel like I'm watching my body experiencing things. Like I'm the coördinator in my head watching through my eyes. I can't really talk or think cuz I feel like my body should talk or think in that situation. I'm just watching what happens and take decisions.

I've had four bars of soap for the past three years... My kitchen sink doesn't work, I wash my one plastic bowl in the bathroom sink.  I don't speak to anyone. I'm essentially already dead. Although I doubt I get 2000 calories a day, the type of foods I've eat have made me gain at least 30 pounds and so none of my clothes fit me. I have one pair of stretchy pajama pants and two tshirts that fit me.  It could be worse, i could be homeless so I've kept this inside for this long but I'm tired. My life is really already over. I'm exhausted. After this month, I won't have internet and I am fairly certain with nothing to do at all, no music etc, I will go insane. So I've made peace with my fate and I guess this is the last month of my life. I don't remember what happiness is. I can't even think of anything that could change my life at this point. There isn't even a dream. There just isn't a point to go on at this point.    


I feel like a failure. I feel sad and hurt. I found one of my mom's journals recently, she mentions she was raped by her father when she was a kid. So that is the energy surrounding me. I'm stuck here, isolated and treated like an animal basically. If I were to die, nobody would care or probably even notice. So thats it. I can't think of anything else to say. But I needed to get it off my chest. Thank you.Transgender Wasted Life"

I am not in college and am unemployed and looking for a job. I've been looking for months, but I live in an isolated area and don't know how to drive so my options are nonexistant. 

When I was in school, I was active in theater and would ask my closest friends to come to my performances, and they had no desire to support me, even though they knew how much it meant to me, even though I offered to arrange a ride for them and pay for their tickets. I was always the one who had to make plans, and my best friends would frequently cancel plans on the day of.

I haven't seen most of my friends since graduation, and most of those I have, when I run into them in public, they ignore me or pretend not to recognize me.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm writing this because I've just once again thought about killing myself but this isn’t even within the first 100 times I have thought of suicide from a young age I’d say roughly around age 11-12 I first thought of just ending it I even remember how I sat at a window ledge looked down and just bathed in the moment before climbing back down with tears coming down my face because I wasn’t strong enough to. 

Wow… well I bet that sounded crazy I wasn’t strong enough to kill myself a direct contradiction of what strength is but a las I and any other who has felt how I feel will relate. 

So about me, of course you must be wondering how did he get this fucked up what has happened. Well im going to let you all know just in case once day I do get my strength. I am one of 10 children slotting in at number 7, I have been emotionally and physically abused by those who were supposed to nourish me. Here’s whats different though so not only did they make my life hell they controlled my life where I was and what I was doing to the extent that I couldn’t even make my own decisions on the little things and still cant. 

Thing’s I have been beaten for just so you get the vibe

·  As a child I would pee in my sleep so I would be woken up by a belt hitting my body

·  As all kids do I would fall asleep on the sofa watching tv, so I would be woken up with a belt hitting my body

·  I once told my dad there was no point in doing something AGAIN because nothing was good enough for him… to which I was beaten with a metal pole until I could no longer use my arms to defend my self and just took blows to the head dripping blood all over the house.

**To summarise I have been fucked up.**

But im trying to figure out how and when this all started at what point did I become the person I am now (Afraid ,insecure ,manipulative and untrustworthy). I give myself these attributes because that’s all I really am. I am afraid of the world horrified possibly I have ran out of classes (IN FUCKING UNI) because I felt as if everyone was looking on me I have this crippling feeling that everyone is always looking at me. Insecure lol I don’t even know what to say I have deleted everything on my social media’s multiple times purely because the anxiety of someone giving a fuck enough to look at them and then the possibility of them finding my pictures funny gives me so much anxiety that I’d prefer them not be there. Am I manipulative yes, but I don’t understand how one can not be manipulative. I like to have things my way of course we all do but I know how to get it done I know how to get responses out of people or to get people to do what I want because I had to learn to. I'm one of fucking 10 children and I showed up in the middle and this wasn’t no brady bunch happy family shit this was controlling, abusive and manipulative and I guess that’s what I became, you are a product of your environment after all. I don’t really know the purpose or direction of this as I have just stopped crying again (its 2:13pm) and decided fuck it imma do this so if I do kms at least maybe one mf’er can know what I been trying to say.

So guys I think im going crazy this is a new development if you don’t mind me starting here, I sit in my room and talk to myself inside my head for hours a day full on conversations (guess this is what happens when you don’t get to train social skills). Sometime’s I cry sometimes I get so angry I don’t even know what to do and sometimes admittedly I feel straight up heart broken as if I have been done a disservice by the world and unfairly I was born into one family instead of another. I fantasize too much and I kind of sorta relate to people from Netflix series. Like Joe the stalker I get it bro you just want to feel a solid love that aint going no where and youll do anything to keep that but in turn you require a few things loyalty being one of them. Fortunately I can say I don’t relate to him with his killing (that would just be another burden in my head to drive me crazier) instead when my heart is broken people just kick the pieces to side and move on. 

Fuuuuuuck im really not good at structuring things I write.

Ok I think the logical thing to do is start with little stories from childhood and work my way to present day. 

I was born in 1998 in Africa and moved to the United Kingdom at a young age not sure how young because I don’t remember. My dad had been previously married and had 5 children from his first wife and at this time only 3 from my mum me and my 2 brothers one a year older one a year younger. It’s said that when I was born they thought I was a fucked up baby, I was going to be disabled or something of the sorts (not in a doctor said it way, but like I was born and they looked at me and said na this aint it way and little would you know my little brother was born just under 10 months later) Fantastic way to start life. So we all lived in one house when we first got to the UK (very vague memory of this shit by the way combination of what I've been told as fact and what I know to be true) So as a kid I have been described as a quiet and timid kid so quiet infact that my older brother and sister (age 12-14) (from a different mother) would pinch me or hit me to make me cry because when I would cry it was funny that I would make no noise.  I was also a huge fan of lion king asking them to watch it multiple times a day with me, everyday. We then moved a couple times memory all blurry and we arrived at the next destination that I remember. We lived in a flat in a small town in England for a couple years, my memories of this place are my   constantly injuring himself severly by playing out, dbz, Toonami, vegeta and ps2. I was a normal kid but I would get fucked up by my dad. (btw im around 4-6 years old) I still remember the time I was called downstairs just to be beaten I think for drawing a rude picture that was discovered after I had just been beaten. Boom boom not too much going on just the entrance to a life of suffering but not too much tbh.  


We then moved to a council house elsewhere just kids and mum because dad had decided its stressful to live with people so he’d rather pay 1k+ rent elsewhere for his own place then help his family. These years weren’t too bad though if anything they were my favourite because he wasn’t around it was just us 3 years in that place from year 2- year 5. He would still drive down though on occasion just to hit us and then return to his home on the flip side of the uk. This was fantastic for my personal growth of course as I learnt that being a father means coming over shouting and arguing with your wife, beating your children and then cutting. And by beating I mean sure we were between ages 7/8-10 but he would hit us with all he had leave belt marks for days all over my body. To the extent the neighbour’s would hear us screaming and would then mock us the next day as we walked to school. He then thought that we were becoming bad children (at the time me and all my siblings were top in our classes thanks to our mum keeping us up to study with her , as well as this at this age we started being forced to go to mosque mon- fri (5-7) and then over the weekends we would go to Arabic school and if we were at home we would play outside in the park so I don’t know how bad we could of really been but who knows.(she was in college so while she did her homework she helped us with ours)). Actually with that being said I would steal from my mum not a lot and not everyday but a pound or 2 here and there just because everyone else in school could afford to buy things like sweets and toys and I would never be able to join in because I had none. I would come home from school and mums not in so id have to sit outside the house for a couple hours people would walk by but I had no friends house to go to like my brothers so I would just sit at the door and wait. My life has been hell maybe its easy from an outside view to say naa aint that bad but try live it everyday you come home aint no body even in, by the time everyone does get in its all at once no time for you and mum to talk no dad asking how was school bruh go to  sleep. To summarize though I was studying everyday 7 days a week and still being beaten along with my brothers but I had a newly born sister and it was time for the move to the big city so fuck it maybe its about to get better.Bruh I forgot and now remembered this nigga would look all 3 of us in the garage for whole days just because and the punishment for leaving would be you get beat and thrown back in there. Think about the mentally how much that would fuck you up you aint even fucking 10 yet.

When we first got to this new city we were quick to discover its rough out there day one we were robbed. They were no more parks we could just go to play at so now I became and indoors kid. To go along with that now my dad didn’t live too far away he was only in the neighbouring town so instead of monthly “visits” it was now weekly. Fair enough to say within a year I had put on I don’t know 10 maybe 15kg I was fat af going into year 7 but in year 6 I was a very thin framed kid. I was depressed and I'm not sure if I knew it but my life consisted of go to school and be bullied to come home and be beaten not knowing where my safe place was I chose solitude I learnt out of sight out of mind (didn’t even work all the time but nigga I tried) My mum became pregnant again… (this was not necessary but I've grown to love the child) so now they are soon to be 5 kids and none of which already receive and adequate amount of love. Just to further paint the character of my father he beat my younger sister who was at the time maybe 3/4 because she took and hid his phone (later revealed he left it in his jacket pocket) NO APOLOGY HAS EVER BEEN GIVEN EVER IN HISTORY FOR A MISTAKEN BEATING. We spent little time in that house but what do ire member being dragged from under a bed to be beaten and being beaten nearly every morning without fail for 1/2  years for bed wetting (punches were not pulled).   


We moved again after same sort of thing really he’d show up for a few days fuck up everyones mood and cut no one wanted him around but no body would say because everyone was afraid of getting beat again. This is the house I lived in when I decided ahh man maybe this life thing isn’t for me went and sat at the window ledge in my room 3rd floor looking down and wished I could just let go. We would be locked in the attic this time the door is genuinely locked we couldn’t get out if we wanted room was what 3x4 meters storage room basically and 3 of us had been locked in there for the whole day. Living in such circumstances created bitch nigga behaviour amongst us as brothers because the beatings were bad you did not want to be beaten it would fuck your whole shit up. So niggas started snitching bruh my own brother came in my room while I was learning to beat my meat took my phone took pictures of what I was watching and then showed everyone while I was sat in the living room… I was then promptly beaten. This the environment I grew up in even in your own fucking room you couldn’t do shit you couldn’t trust nobody and you were very likely going to be fucked up for anything you did. This could include but was not limited to holding your brothers hand while fighting… (that’s gay apparently so you would be beaten). Defending yourself to your parents (Its rude to speak back so I was beaten), Not speaking (its rude to not speak when spoken to so I was beaten). Finishing the milk bruh imagine your 12 year old hungry self wanted some cereal finished it and then gone beaten for it that was my fucking life. Id go to school this fat unloved ugly kid, (I think this is a good time to point out I went to a bad school in a white neighbour hood and as we all know aint nothing scarier than poor white people jk…) but those guys were harsh to me day one of highschool I had a fight why because I was being racially abused, I was constantly racially abused I was not even accepted by my own race because I wasn’t black enough (I am quarter white 3 quated black so skin color dark brown meant I was a paki, I was an Indian I was a terrorist osama bin laden was my uncle so on and so forth) aint no body ever gave a shit about me not a single teacher not no body. And this is where things get fucked up for me this when I started doing dumb shit I started being a prick to my friends not fully understanding what was even going on but just thinking out of I gotta cover my back I gotta make sure I aint no punk but in reality it made me into a punk. But ill get to that later. I still remember everything nice people have ever said to me that I felt was said genuinely though, once the most popular kid in school told me to not let anyone pick on me and just tell them im not Asian although I had tried both I felt his sincerity and very much appreciated it and still think about it to this day. 

I wanna fast forward now to year 11 when shit really hits the fan, I moved to a school which was mixed gender (years 7-10 I was in a boy school) and the introduction of women had definitely caught my eyes (hadn’t seen them in many years since everyday was school mosque home runescape repeat maaaaaaaaaan FUCK THAT SHIT that’s the worst childhood and to make it better slide a couple hundred beatings in over those 3 years and now you might be beginning to get a grasp on who I am as a person. Of course they are little moments when things workout but not really. To summarise I was in love or atleast I felt like I was I did horribly on my exams which at the time I accreted to me just focusing my time on her and not myself and that started the downwards spiral. My little brother told my parents I wasn’t fasting at prom (I have not ever fasted a day since, pretty sure I gave up on religion a long time ago but that’s its own thing) and I was beaten then locked in the house so I could not attend my final meeting for NCS (I had saved up my 5 a week for 10 weeks to pay the 50 to go and now I just couldn’t imagine that feeling I was going to finally be away from this whole home all summer and now I couldn’t why because my dad who had now moved in full time had decided to spite me).  


The summer of finishing high school of enjoyment had arrived my plans to be with my friends had been put to a halt. My plans of going to a top 3 college in the city had been put to a halt. My summer was instead me just sitting in my room everyday the whole summer alone not talking to anyone for multiple days at a time. This is when my solitude became serious I became an awkward nervous rek after this I couldn’t even talk to people properly without overthinking everything id say if summer was 10 days long I was beaten on 6/7 days as well so yh torture house and to make it better I had no friends because we moved so fucking much I didn’t know a single person and couldn’t get to know them because we lived in a jewish neighbour hood and if you’ve ever lived in one as the only black muslim family you aint going to have no friend. But yh returned to college and it was ok except for everyday I would come home and be locked out of my house everyday without fail my dad would sit in the kitchen looking out the window and laugh at me having nowhere else to go so I would sit in the gardens storage cupboard nothing much at all probably just a big wardrobe but It was dry. I would then go to college and repeat this process day by day mentally exhausting my self little by little more once again through in beatings on.4 out of every 10 days and you have the image of what my first year of college was like. My parents decided as a family we should read the quran together (muslim people book not all of it like a page each a day) so I read my page and left and while I was goning upstairs I heard him talking about me so I decided ah im probably going to be beaten let me stay here and wait so I did and soon enough I heard him say “why did he read that page, he read that a few days ago hes looking for the easy ones” so my mum said “ill call him back down and he can read again”, I was called “….. come downstairs and read again” and I replied “Whats the point nothing I do is good enough for him anyway” to which he responded by walking into the kitchen getting a metal pole and coming to hit me with it. The best bit for him it was a detached house so no one could even hear my screams. At first I tried to block with my left arm and then I just couldn’t hold it up anymore so I switched to the right and the same happened so then I was just lying there being beaten by my dad with a metal pole bleeding all over the floor from my head and when he thought he was done he left. This day is the day I lost my shit as soon as I could stand I went and grabbed a knife but was stopped by my mother (I always found it funny how she would always come to stop me but never him). I then called the police when they arrived they was so much blood on the ground floor corridor that she threw shoes over to hide it because it could not be cleaned while he sat there on the sofa smug knowing he had gotten away with it my mum had hidden me from the police and that was that another great day in the life. 

I had become sick of it and told my mum I do not care what she thinks I am tired and I am leaving I will go to foster care if I must but I am not dealing with this shit anymore (I don’t know if its important but I was also 17 without a phone or laptop or any communication with the outside world, if I was in my room all day I was playing badminton against the wall staring at the ceiling or creating fantasies in my mind to rescue me from where I was currently) I told her ill get a job (just received ni number) ill figure it out for myself and what did she do?

She said nothing for maybe a month and then we were moving house so she came in one morning and just told me we are moving pack up so I did thinking we are moving away from that cunt and she had chosen me her son over her manipulative controlling abusive husband… Instead she had rented another place and just dropped me off there would come round maybe every month or 2 for an hour or so and that was my life. Now I was completely secluded and this was the first time I actually tried to kill myself I had a panic attack the anxiety just got to me I took all my sleeping pills at once and boom I woke up the next day… they were all fucking natural herbal things and they couldn’t do shit. Bummer I know. She still doesn’t know about this I continued thinking about killing my self shit I never stopped from that first time till now but It was just thoughts and ideas I had finally tried to and failed. Instead I started smoking weed which would help sometimes but other times like I learnt the hardway it would make me think about my life and whats actually happened and compare it to my peers around me and I would breakdown crying. My life has no direction, I have no family around me (which is ironic in a family of 13(3 parents 10 kids))because we had all been tormented soo much we didn’t know to look out for eachother we had to look out for our selves first. This is why im selfish I cant afford to not be because if im not my own number 1 In terms of in a greedy way like If I don’t look out for ME first no one else will. My mum then told me she didn’t want to continue paying for where I lived and I had to find somewhere else (now that I was 18/19) which is a real bitch because if I had just done what I wanted to years back and left this family of suffering I would have been alright but instead now im going to college everyday thinking about where tf am I going to live. So I dropped out of college to work, I ended up returning to college having to restart living in a city different to the one I studied in working night shifts to then go straight in to class but I figured it out. Got to uni and guess what I don’t know what the fuck is going on. 

Everyone is social and I don’t know how to socialise sometimes I feel as though I stand out so badly that im just not supposed to be there im surrounded by people who life has blessed people who have seen the world people whos parents love them soo much that they even come to watch them train at uni. In my whole fucking life there has never been a single thing I've done which I can say I looked into the crowd and had a single person there to support me. Instead I have been told to dream is free, I've been told your not going to make anything with your life and you are going to be a failure. Honestly I have accepted these as truths now. I don’t even feel like myself anymore I feel stupid as if i took a couple too many hits to the head information doesn’t sink in properly anymore. I'm embarraced in class because everyone else knows what they are doing to some level I have no fucking idea everyone else goes home for Christmas or there family comes to visit. LOOOL my family don’t give a single fuck. I AM ALONE IN THIS WORLD TIRED DEPRESSED AND READY TO GO. I accepted death a little while back, one night I was lying in bed crying and realised I don’t have to deal with this anymore I really don’t I have accepted I will kill myself and I am just waiting for the day in which I get my final little nudge to step of the ledge.

I just want to be at peace.

I also had a girlfriend for a while she cheated on me so I stopped valuing her as a person and just kept her for the other stuff. She even got pregnant and aborted it. I'm 20.

&amp;#x200B;

Question… am I crazy for feeling like this? And if you were in my shoes do you think you would feel the same or different.",t2_3qljti1z,False,,0,False,I dont know if its worth the read but this is my life this is how i feel and if you do read it can you answer the question at the end. thank you,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,False,t3_fdx7d2,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583452405.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m writing this because I&amp;#39;ve just once again thought about killing myself but this isn’t even within the first 100 times I have thought of suicide from a young age I’d say roughly around age 11-12 I first thought of just ending it I even remember how I sat at a window ledge looked down and just bathed in the moment before climbing back down with tears coming down my face because I wasn’t strong enough to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow… well I bet that sounded crazy I wasn’t strong enough to kill myself a direct contradiction of what strength is but a las I and any other who has felt how I feel will relate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So about me, of course you must be wondering how did he get this fucked up what has happened. Well im going to let you all know just in case once day I do get my strength. I am one of 10 children slotting in at number 7, I have been emotionally and physically abused by those who were supposed to nourish me. Here’s whats different though so not only did they make my life hell they controlled my life where I was and what I was doing to the extent that I couldn’t even make my own decisions on the little things and still cant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thing’s I have been beaten for just so you get the vibe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·  As a child I would pee in my sleep so I would be woken up by a belt hitting my body&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·  As all kids do I would fall asleep on the sofa watching tv, so I would be woken up with a belt hitting my body&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·  I once told my dad there was no point in doing something AGAIN because nothing was good enough for him… to which I was beaten with a metal pole until I could no longer use my arms to defend my self and just took blows to the head dripping blood all over the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To summarise I have been fucked up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But im trying to figure out how and when this all started at what point did I become the person I am now (Afraid ,insecure ,manipulative and untrustworthy). I give myself these attributes because that’s all I really am. I am afraid of the world horrified possibly I have ran out of classes (IN FUCKING UNI) because I felt as if everyone was looking on me I have this crippling feeling that everyone is always looking at me. Insecure lol I don’t even know what to say I have deleted everything on my social media’s multiple times purely because the anxiety of someone giving a fuck enough to look at them and then the possibility of them finding my pictures funny gives me so much anxiety that I’d prefer them not be there. Am I manipulative yes, but I don’t understand how one can not be manipulative. I like to have things my way of course we all do but I know how to get it done I know how to get responses out of people or to get people to do what I want because I had to learn to. I&amp;#39;m one of fucking 10 children and I showed up in the middle and this wasn’t no brady bunch happy family shit this was controlling, abusive and manipulative and I guess that’s what I became, you are a product of your environment after all. I don’t really know the purpose or direction of this as I have just stopped crying again (its 2:13pm) and decided fuck it imma do this so if I do kms at least maybe one mf’er can know what I been trying to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So guys I think im going crazy this is a new development if you don’t mind me starting here, I sit in my room and talk to myself inside my head for hours a day full on conversations (guess this is what happens when you don’t get to train social skills). Sometime’s I cry sometimes I get so angry I don’t even know what to do and sometimes admittedly I feel straight up heart broken as if I have been done a disservice by the world and unfairly I was born into one family instead of another. I fantasize too much and I kind of sorta relate to people from Netflix series. Like Joe the stalker I get it bro you just want to feel a solid love that aint going no where and youll do anything to keep that but in turn you require a few things loyalty being one of them. Fortunately I can say I don’t relate to him with his killing (that would just be another burden in my head to drive me crazier) instead when my heart is broken people just kick the pieces to side and move on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuuuuuuck im really not good at structuring things I write.&lt;/p&gt;

This is when my solitude became serious I became an awkward nervous rek after this I couldn’t even talk to people properly without overthinking everything id say if summer was 10 days long I was beaten on 6/7 days as well so yh torture house and to make it better I had no friends because we moved so fucking much I didn’t know a single person and couldn’t get to know them because we lived in a jewish neighbour hood and if you’ve ever lived in one as the only black muslim family you aint going to have no friend. But yh returned to college and it was ok except for everyday I would come home and be locked out of my house everyday without fail my dad would sit in the kitchen looking out the window and laugh at me having nowhere else to go so I would sit in the gardens storage cupboard nothing much at all probably just a big wardrobe but It was dry. I would then go to college and repeat this process day by day mentally exhausting my self little by little more once again through in beatings on.4 out of every 10 days and you have the image of what my first year of college was like. My parents decided as a family we should read the quran together (muslim people book not all of it like a page each a day) so I read my page and left and while I was goning upstairs I heard him talking about me so I decided ah im probably going to be beaten let me stay here and wait so I did and soon enough I heard him say “why did he read that page, he read that a few days ago hes looking for the easy ones” so my mum said “ill call him back down and he can read again”, I was called “….. come downstairs and read again” and I replied “Whats the point nothing I do is good enough for him anyway” to which he responded by walking into the kitchen getting a metal pole and coming to hit me with it. The best bit for him it was a detached house so no one could even hear my screams. At first I tried to block with my left arm and then I just couldn’t hold it up anymore so I switched to the right and the same happened so then I was just lying there being beaten by my dad with a metal pole bleeding all over the floor from my head and when he thought he was done he left. This day is the day I lost my shit as soon as I could stand I went and grabbed a knife but was stopped by my mother (I always found it funny how she would always come to stop me but never him). I then called the police when they arrived they was so much blood on the ground floor corridor that she threw shoes over to hide it because it could not be cleaned while he sat there on the sofa smug knowing he had gotten away with it my mum had hidden me from the police and that was that another great day in the life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had become sick of it and told my mum I do not care what she thinks I am tired and I am leaving I will go to foster care if I must but I am not dealing with this shit anymore (I don’t know if its important but I was also 17 without a phone or laptop or any communication with the outside world, if I was in my room all day I was playing badminton against the wall staring at the ceiling or creating fantasies in my mind to rescue me from where I was currently) I told her ill get a job (just received ni number) ill figure it out for myself and what did she do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said nothing for maybe a month and then we were moving house so she came in one morning and just told me we are moving pack up so I did thinking we are moving away from that cunt and she had chosen me her son over her manipulative controlling abusive husband… Instead she had rented another place and just dropped me off there would come round maybe every month or 2 for an hour or so and that was my life. Now I was completely secluded and this was the first time I actually tried to kill myself I had a panic attack the anxiety just got to me I took all my sleeping pills at once and boom I woke up the next day… they were all fucking natural herbal things and they couldn’t do shit. Bummer I know. She still doesn’t know about this I continued thinking about killing my self shit I never stopped from that first time till now but It was just thoughts and ideas I had finally tried to and failed. Instead I started smoking weed which would help sometimes but other times like I learnt the hardway it would make me think about my life and whats actually happened and compare it to my peers around me and I would breakdown crying. My life has no direction, I have no family around me (which is ironic in a family of 13(3 parents 10 kids))because we had all been tormented soo much we didn’t know to look out for eachother we had to look out for our selves first. This is why im selfish I cant afford to not be because if im not my own number 1 In terms of in a greedy way like If I don’t look out for ME first no one else will. My mum then told me she didn’t want to continue paying for where I lived and I had to find somewhere else (now that I was 18/19) which is a real bitch because if I had just done what I wanted to years back and left this family of suffering I would have been alright but instead now im going to college everyday thinking about where tf am I going to live. So I dropped out of college to work, I ended up returning to college having to restart living in a city different to the one I studied in working night shifts to then go straight in to class but I figured it out. Got to uni and guess what I don’t know what the fuck is going on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is social and I don’t know how to socialise sometimes I feel as though I stand out so badly that im just not supposed to be there im surrounded by people who life has blessed people who have seen the world people whos parents love them soo much that they even come to watch them train at uni. In my whole fucking life there has never been a single thing I&amp;#39;ve done which I can say I looked into the crowd and had a single person there to support me. Instead I have been told to dream is free, I&amp;#39;ve been told your not going to make anything with your life and you are going to be a failure. Honestly I have accepted these as truths now. I don’t even feel like myself anymore I feel stupid as if i took a couple too many hits to the head information doesn’t sink in properly anymore. I&amp;#39;m embarraced in class because everyone else knows what they are doing to some level I have no fucking idea everyone else goes home for Christmas or there family comes to visit. LOOOL my family don’t give a single fuck. I AM ALONE IN THIS WORLD TIRED DEPRESSED AND READY TO GO. I accepted death a little while back, one night I was lying in bed crying and realised I don’t have to deal with this anymore I really don’t I have accepted I will kill myself and I am just waiting for the day in which I get my final little nudge to step of the ledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to be at peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had a girlfriend for a while she cheated on me so I stopped valuing her as a person and just kept her for the other stuff. She even got pregnant and aborted it. I&amp;#39;m 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question… am I crazy for feeling like this? And if you were in my shoes do you think you would feel the same or different.&lt;/p&gt;

Wow… well I bet that sounded crazy I wasn’t strong enough to kill myself a direct contradiction of what strength is but a las I and any other who has felt how I feel will relate. 

So about me, of course you must be wondering how did he get this fucked up what has happened. Well im going to let you all know just in case once day I do get my strength. I am one of 10 children slotting in at number 7, I have been emotionally and physically abused by those who were supposed to nourish me. Here’s whats different though so not only did they make my life hell they controlled my life where I was and what I was doing to the extent that I couldn’t even make my own decisions on the little things and still cant. 

Thing’s I have been beaten for just so you get the vibe

·  As a child I would pee in my sleep so I would be woken up by a belt hitting my body

·  As all kids do I would fall asleep on the sofa watching tv, so I would be woken up with a belt hitting my body

·  I once told my dad there was no point in doing something AGAIN because nothing was good enough for him… to which I was beaten with a metal pole until I could no longer use my arms to defend my self and just took blows to the head dripping blood all over the house.

**To summarise I have been fucked up.**

But im trying to figure out how and when this all started at what point did I become the person I am now (Afraid ,insecure ,manipulative and untrustworthy). I give myself these attributes because that’s all I really am. I am afraid of the world horrified possibly I have ran out of classes (IN FUCKING UNI) because I felt as if everyone was looking on me I have this crippling feeling that everyone is always looking at me. Insecure lol I don’t even know what to say I have deleted everything on my social media’s multiple times purely because the anxiety of someone giving a fuck enough to look at them and then the possibility of them finding my pictures funny gives me so much anxiety that I’d prefer them not be there. Am I manipulative yes, but I don’t understand how one can not be manipulative. I like to have things my way of course we all do but I know how to get it done I know how to get responses out of people or to get people to do what I want because I had to learn to. I'm one of fucking 10 children and I showed up in the middle and this wasn’t no brady bunch happy family shit this was controlling, abusive and manipulative and I guess that’s what I became, you are a product of your environment after all. I don’t really know the purpose or direction of this as I have just stopped crying again (its 2:13pm) and decided fuck it imma do this so if I do kms at least maybe one mf’er can know what I been trying to say.

So guys I think im going crazy this is a new development if you don’t mind me starting here, I sit in my room and talk to myself inside my head for hours a day full on conversations (guess this is what happens when you don’t get to train social skills). Sometime’s I cry sometimes I get so angry I don’t even know what to do and sometimes admittedly I feel straight up heart broken as if I have been done a disservice by the world and unfairly I was born into one family instead of another. I fantasize too much and I kind of sorta relate to people from Netflix series. Like Joe the stalker I get it bro you just want to feel a solid love that aint going no where and youll do anything to keep that but in turn you require a few things loyalty being one of them. Fortunately I can say I don’t relate to him with his killing (that would just be another burden in my head to drive me crazier) instead when my heart is broken people just kick the pieces to side and move on. 

Fuuuuuuck im really not good at structuring things I write.

Ok I think the logical thing to do is start with little stories from childhood and work my way to present day. 

I was born in 1998 in Africa and moved to the United Kingdom at a young age not sure how young because I don’t remember. My dad had been previously married and had 5 children from his first wife and at this time only 3 from my mum me and my 2 brothers one a year older one a year younger. It’s said that when I was born they thought I was a fucked up baby, I was going to be disabled or something of the sorts (not in a doctor said it way, but like I was born and they looked at me and said na this aint it way and little would you know my little brother was born just under 10 months later) Fantastic way to start life. So we all lived in one house when we first got to the UK (very vague memory of this shit by the way combination of what I've been told as fact and what I know to be true) So as a kid I have been described as a quiet and timid kid so quiet infact that my older brother and sister (age 12-14) (from a different mother) would pinch me or hit me to make me cry because when I would cry it was funny that I would make no noise.  I was also a huge fan of lion king asking them to watch it multiple times a day with me, everyday. We then moved a couple times memory all blurry and we arrived at the next destination that I remember. We lived in a flat in a small town in England for a couple years, my memories of this place are my   constantly injuring himself severly by playing out, dbz, Toonami, vegeta and ps2. I was a normal kid but I would get fucked up by my dad. (btw im around 4-6 years old) I still remember the time I was called downstairs just to be beaten I think for drawing a rude picture that was discovered after I had just been beaten. Boom boom not too much going on just the entrance to a life of suffering but not too much tbh.  


We then moved to a council house elsewhere just kids and mum because dad had decided its stressful to live with people so he’d rather pay 1k+ rent elsewhere for his own place then help his family. These years weren’t too bad though if anything they were my favourite because he wasn’t around it was just us 3 years in that place from year 2- year 5. He would still drive down though on occasion just to hit us and then return to his home on the flip side of the uk. This was fantastic for my personal growth of course as I learnt that being a father means coming over shouting and arguing with your wife, beating your children and then cutting. And by beating I mean sure we were between ages 7/8-10 but he would hit us with all he had leave belt marks for days all over my body. To the extent the neighbour’s would hear us screaming and would then mock us the next day as we walked to school. He then thought that we were becoming bad children (at the time me and all my siblings were top in our classes thanks to our mum keeping us up to study with her , as well as this at this age we started being forced to go to mosque mon- fri (5-7) and then over the weekends we would go to Arabic school and if we were at home we would play outside in the park so I don’t know how bad we could of really been but who knows.(she was in college so while she did her homework she helped us with ours)). Actually with that being said I would steal from my mum not a lot and not everyday but a pound or 2 here and there just because everyone else in school could afford to buy things like sweets and toys and I would never be able to join in because I had none. I would come home from school and mums not in so id have to sit outside the house for a couple hours people would walk by but I had no friends house to go to like my brothers so I would just sit at the door and wait. My life has been hell maybe its easy from an outside view to say naa aint that bad but try live it everyday you come home aint no body even in, by the time everyone does get in its all at once no time for you and mum to talk no dad asking how was school bruh go to  sleep. To summarize though I was studying everyday 7 days a week and still being beaten along with my brothers but I had a newly born sister and it was time for the move to the big city so fuck it maybe its about to get better.Bruh I forgot and now remembered this nigga would look all 3 of us in the garage for whole days just because and the punishment for leaving would be you get beat and thrown back in there. Think about the mentally how much that would fuck you up you aint even fucking 10 yet.

When we first got to this new city we were quick to discover its rough out there day one we were robbed. They were no more parks we could just go to play at so now I became and indoors kid. To go along with that now my dad didn’t live too far away he was only in the neighbouring town so instead of monthly “visits” it was now weekly. Fair enough to say within a year I had put on I don’t know 10 maybe 15kg I was fat af going into year 7 but in year 6 I was a very thin framed kid. I was depressed and I'm not sure if I knew it but my life consisted of go to school and be bullied to come home and be beaten not knowing where my safe place was I chose solitude I learnt out of sight out of mind (didn’t even work all the time but nigga I tried) My mum became pregnant again… (this was not necessary but I've grown to love the child) so now they are soon to be 5 kids and none of which already receive and adequate amount of love. Just to further paint the character of my father he beat my younger sister who was at the time maybe 3/4 because she took and hid his phone (later revealed he left it in his jacket pocket) NO APOLOGY HAS EVER BEEN GIVEN EVER IN HISTORY FOR A MISTAKEN BEATING. We spent little time in that house but what do ire member being dragged from under a bed to be beaten and being beaten nearly every morning without fail for 1/2  years for bed wetting (punches were not pulled).   


We moved again after same sort of thing really he’d show up for a few days fuck up everyones mood and cut no one wanted him around but no body would say because everyone was afraid of getting beat again. This is the house I lived in when I decided ahh man maybe this life thing isn’t for me went and sat at the window ledge in my room 3rd floor looking down and wished I could just let go. We would be locked in the attic this time the door is genuinely locked we couldn’t get out if we wanted room was what 3x4 meters storage room basically and 3 of us had been locked in there for the whole day. Living in such circumstances created bitch nigga behaviour amongst us as brothers because the beatings were bad you did not want to be beaten it would fuck your whole shit up. So niggas started snitching bruh my own brother came in my room while I was learning to beat my meat took my phone took pictures of what I was watching and then showed everyone while I was sat in the living room… I was then promptly beaten. This the environment I grew up in even in your own fucking room you couldn’t do shit you couldn’t trust nobody and you were very likely going to be fucked up for anything you did. This could include but was not limited to holding your brothers hand while fighting… (that’s gay apparently so you would be beaten). Defending yourself to your parents (Its rude to speak back so I was beaten), Not speaking (its rude to not speak when spoken to so I was beaten). Finishing the milk bruh imagine your 12 year old hungry self wanted some cereal finished it and then gone beaten for it that was my fucking life. Id go to school this fat unloved ugly kid, (I think this is a good time to point out I went to a bad school in a white neighbour hood and as we all know aint nothing scarier than poor white people jk…) but those guys were harsh to me day one of highschool I had a fight why because I was being racially abused, I was constantly racially abused I was not even accepted by my own race because I wasn’t black enough (I am quarter white 3 quated black so skin color dark brown meant I was a paki, I was an Indian I was a terrorist osama bin laden was my uncle so on and so forth) aint no body ever gave a shit about me not a single teacher not no body. And this is where things get fucked up for me this when I started doing dumb shit I started being a prick to my friends not fully understanding what was even going on but just thinking out of I gotta cover my back I gotta make sure I aint no punk but in reality it made me into a punk. But ill get to that later. I still remember everything nice people have ever said to me that I felt was said genuinely though, once the most popular kid in school told me to not let anyone pick on me and just tell them im not Asian although I had tried both I felt his sincerity and very much appreciated it and still think about it to this day. 

I wanna fast forward now to year 11 when shit really hits the fan, I moved to a school which was mixed gender (years 7-10 I was in a boy school) and the introduction of women had definitely caught my eyes (hadn’t seen them in many years since everyday was school mosque home runescape repeat maaaaaaaaaan FUCK THAT SHIT that’s the worst childhood and to make it better slide a couple hundred beatings in over those 3 years and now you might be beginning to get a grasp on who I am as a person. Of course they are little moments when things workout but not really. To summarise I was in love or atleast I felt like I was I did horribly on my exams which at the time I accreted to me just focusing my time on her and not myself and that started the downwards spiral. My little brother told my parents I wasn’t fasting at prom (I have not ever fasted a day since, pretty sure I gave up on religion a long time ago but that’s its own thing) and I was beaten then locked in the house so I could not attend my final meeting for NCS (I had saved up my 5 a week for 10 weeks to pay the 50 to go and now I just couldn’t imagine that feeling I was going to finally be away from this whole home all summer and now I couldn’t why because my dad who had now moved in full time had decided to spite me).  


The summer of finishing high school of enjoyment had arrived my plans to be with my friends had been put to a halt. My plans of going to a top 3 college in the city had been put to a halt. My summer was instead me just sitting in my room everyday the whole summer alone not talking to anyone for multiple days at a time.

,SuicideWatch,"I don’t really know what to right tbh

I’m a 15 year old trans guy, came out when I was like 11 and waited on the Tavistock (the uk gender clinic) for like 3 years and then once I got there they distarged me cos I don’t have any fucking friends anymore and my step dad was being a prick so that apparently means I don’t know shit about myself, we literally only had like idk 3 meetings. I had been waiting so fucking long for this. I feel so fucking dysphoric all the fucking time I hate my body so fucking much. I just want enough testosterone to at least make my voice a little deeper. And what’s pushed me to the edge is when I went out yesterday literally 5 people called me a girl and my mum and step dad have pretty much given up on calling me a boy and by my pronouns, they always call me a girl/thier daughter and use she/her. And even if I do get to transition this society is so fucking transphobic like just on fucking twitter or some shit and on every post to do with trans folks it’s always so negative like there’s a whole wave of even cis lgbt ppl hating us. Literally what’s the fucking point. I’ve already attempted suicide over this when I was 12 and camhs did absolutely nothing, no therapist or anything. I have not a single friend except for like one online friend and literally every family member that was like ‘oooh you tried to kill yourself this is so sad’ has hardly spoken to me since plus I haven’t even met half of my family and my biological dad hardly ever speaks to and keeps on arranging times for us to meet them cancelling like the only person that might actually be upset about me dying is my cat.

Anyway, I already have 2 codomsl pills with me right now and according to google I only need like 5 in one go to kill myself and there’s probably way more in the house so yeah can’t be arsed with life and I have literally ~nothing~ to live for so, goodbye",t2_5gcagsz5,False,,0,False,I think I’m going to kill myself tonight,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,False,t3_fdno60,False,dark,,public,27,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,27,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1583401142.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t really know what to right tbh&lt;/p&gt;

I’m a 15 year old trans guy, came out when I was like 11 and waited on the Tavistock (the uk gender clinic) for like 3 years and then once I got there they distarged me cos I don’t have any fucking friends anymore and my step dad was being a prick so that apparently means I don’t know shit about myself, we literally only had like idk 3 meetings. I had been waiting so fucking long for this. I feel so fucking dysphoric all the fucking time I hate my body so fucking much. I just want enough testosterone to at least make my voice a little deeper.

I can't do anything useful in my life until I become an adult, I ruin almost everything, I cut a lot and am always worried someone will see the scars. I get confused when I see people genuinely enjoying themselves and having fun. It blows my mind. How are they so happy? How can anyone love themselves? I don't love myself. I'm fact I hate myself. Because I deserve it. What use am I to anyone? 

The answer is none. I'm not of any use. And you know why? It's because whenever I've tried to be useful I mess it up. So, what's the point? What the point of enduring an existence that I can't seem to enjoy? I haven't been diagnosed with depression, so I'm not going to claim that I have it. But, what other explanation is there? And even if that is the explanation, does it even matter? Does anything really matter?

I just wish i could stop existing. I dont want to live anymore, and everyday is a struggle. Im devasted about the fact that im gonna put my family through this, but the pain is to hudge. I dont want to be here anymore, and someday im gonna have the courage to end it. I hope so.My story - from happy to suicidal"

,SuicideWatch,"Not gonna lie, I feel like a fucking dumbass typing this. But I’m failing at life, really want to die, and am too embarrassed to explain to the people closest to me that I would rather die than proceed with my futile attempts at life. So here I am, on reddit, for some unknown fucking reason. I guess I just need to vent and this seems like the best place because I’m sure no one I know will look here. So here it goes

I’m 23. Live in my parents basement with an amazing girl that I really don’t deserve. Most of my life I’ve been the quiet kid. Most people were scared of me in school because of that, but I’m too much of a pussy to actually do anything. Only reason anyone would talk to me was because I played football and went to school with most of my team. 

From elementary school through middle school I was really fucking ugly. Acne was terrible, huge fucking nose, no confidence. Had like 2 encounters with girls during this time period and I was a hardcore “nice guy.” Those 2 encounters were enough for everyone to realize I’m pretty fucking retarded. So most people avoided me. High school I peaked. (and by peak I really don’t mean much. Just the time that I wasn’t absolutely pathetic) Met the girl I’m with now, got in really good shape and did pretty good in football. Managed to get fucking C’s all throughout though so I got no scholarship for college. 

After high school my parents were amazing enough to pay for my college. 5000 fucking dollars a semester for me to do average my first semester then fail calculus my second semester. After my second semester I let my father convince me that I should go to school closer to home and do electrical engineering. First semester I did average. Next semester I failed fucking Chemistry and lab. Semester after that I failed my chemistry lab again so I had to switch to Computer engineering. Semester after that I failed Pde’s. Pretty much every semester after that I’ve failed classes. Not because I’m not learning the material but because I’m so fucking lazy I don’t do half the homework. Usually my homework grades suck but my test scores are good but not good enough to keep me from failing. Every year my parents keep telling me that they are going to make me move out and pay for my own school, but they keep giving me more chances and I keep royal fucking those chances. Honestly don’t understand why they give me so many chances. 

Anyways, this year isn’t any different. Last semester I took 3 fucking classes (9 credit hours) and failed all three of my classes. Worst I’ve ever done. So this current semester I’m retaking 2 of the 3 I failed and just had to withdraw from one of them and the other I will probably get a C in. I don’t get it. I have a part time job at fucking Chili’s, I live at home, have everything going for me; don’t have to worry about expenses, amazing girlfriend, family that loves me. Yet I can’t fucking pass two fucking classes.

I’m a failure. Honestly no other explanation. I get to tell my mother that after this semester I am dropping out and moving out, therefore waisting 50,000$ of her money. Thing is, if I can’t pass two fucking classes how the fuck an I suppose to live on my own. Other thing is, I wouldn’t be on my own, my girlfriend would be with me which makes everything worse because I would be dragging her down with me. So instead of moving out I have decided I should probably just kill myself. I’ve planned it out for the most part. I have a 30-06 in my room that guarantees my death, I’ve scouted a place out where no one will be able to find my corpse. I haven’t written my goodbye letter because I’m honestly too pathetic to write one and probably won’t even leave one, I plan on depositing all of my money into an account that my girlfriend has access to so she can get out of this house as quickly as possible if need be, etc...

I know my death will negatively impact those closest too me but I’m almost positive my parents will get over it. Honestly my father has given up on me so I don’t think he’ll care much. My grandparents will be devastated but they will get over it.
Only one I’m worried about is my girlfriend. She’s about to start a new job right when I plan on killing myself and I don’t want to ruin that. I’m sure I can figure something out.

At the same time. I really don’t want to die. It still breaks my heart that I have to leave everything behind. My family has two amazing dogs that I would die for, I managed to go out with a girl way out of my league for 5 years that’s about to get a job relevant to her dream career, I have grandparents, aunts, and uncles that all seem to like me, etc...

Guess I’ll just bring a couple bottles to try and get over that heartbreak so I can pull the trigger.

Anyways, sorry to start my own fucking pity party. It was just hurting me to not say or write anything before I die since I’ve done relatively good at hiding my depression from everyone.

,SuicideWatch,"So I’ve been depressed since about 4. Started cutting around 12, the same time I had my first flashback to the first time I was raped. I made serval attempts since I was 16, never really trying hard enough. But tonight I really really really wanted to do it. I tried cutting myself but the knife I got wasn’t sharp enough... my boyfriend ended up calling me in the middle of everything. So I talked to him about it, I was on hold with the suicide hotline anyways.

I guess I didn’t REALLY want to otherwise it would’ve worked? I’ve always heard of people just cutting, but it ends up going too deep and that’s how they almost die. Don’t know why I’m writing this.. actually I do I want to hear from someone. Encouragement, your story, anything.

All I can think about is myself. How many times I've attempted it and failed. How much of an asshole I am for wanting to put that suffering onto others, and yet how much I want my death to impact people. I feel like I'm not suffering bad enough if I don't kill myself. At the same time, I'm convinced suicide is no longer even an option taken how many times I've survived.

,SuicideWatch,"Ive been depressed for a couple of years now, ive been suicidal too for the past 3 years. One of the main reasons is my family. I’m an outsider to them, i chose that i don’t want to be religious or what they wanted me to be. They tried to mould me into the model son, i hate it. Ive spoke on to a lot of people online, who’ve become my close friends, but in the beginning of this year, i lost my closest friend, of 3 years. He was an inspiration to me, and now that he’s gone i feel alone. I have friends still but they slowly drift further each coming day.

Recently, i was telling dark jokes as a coping mechanism, it helps relieve stress when i make jokes about stuff. I slipped up and made a joke that offended a girl in my class, she went to the head of student affairs in my school and complained about me, despite having apologised at least 5 times. Parents got involved too, and news spreads like wildfire. I don’t feel like going to school tomorrow, because the last thing i want is this stress from my peers.

Its not my peers that are the problem though, it’s my family. They’re religious and believe you should never joke about the stuff i do. (I still joke about the things i do because my mental state has deteriorated). I have depression, insomnia and ptsd. My family doesn’t know. In about an hour i have to either confess everything that’s wrong, which’ll probably give me shit to deal with x20 worse, or i can kill myself today. Im heavily weighing the options. I don’t want to live, to suffer, anymore. I’ve attempted in the past and i pussied out in the last moments. But this time, if i have to, i will. I can’t live like this anymore. I’d probably get disowned if i called the child support hotline, and i go to a private school on an academic scholarship, so i’ll have to move schools, which’d mean i’d lose my closest friends in real life.

Im pretty much failing every class, flunking every class, i don’t do work anymore, im constantly in pain. My head thumps everyday with migraines and i cant focus, i can only stay sane from my dogs and music. Im in love with videogames, but my pc died last september so i havent been able to play and it made me really sad. 

I just want some incentive to live, to keep going, but i cant see anything but my future going dim. I’m in school typing this out. Im hoping by some insane luck that i can make it through this.

One of the main reasons is my family. I’m an outsider to them, i chose that i don’t want to be religious or what they wanted me to be. They tried to mould me into the model son, i hate it. Ive spoke on to a lot of people online, who’ve become my close friends, but in the beginning of this year, i lost my closest friend, of 3 years. He was an inspiration to me, and now that he’s gone i feel alone. I have friends still but they slowly drift further each coming day.

Recently, i was telling dark jokes as a coping mechanism, it helps relieve stress when i make jokes about stuff. I slipped up and made a joke that offended a girl in my class, she went to the head of student affairs in my school and complained about me, despite having apologised at least 5 times. Parents got involved too, and news spreads like wildfire. I don’t feel like going to school tomorrow, because the last thing i want is this stress from my peers.

Its not my peers that are the problem though, it’s my family. They’re religious and believe you should never joke about the stuff i do. (I still joke about the things i do because my mental state has deteriorated). I have depression, insomnia and ptsd. My family doesn’t know. In about an hour i have to either confess everything that’s wrong, which’ll probably give me shit to deal with x20 worse, or i can kill myself today. Im heavily weighing the options. I don’t want to live, to suffer, anymore. I’ve attempted in the past and i pussied out in the last moments. But this time, if i have to, i will. I can’t live like this anymore. I’d probably get disowned if i called the child support hotline, and i go to a private school on an academic scholarship, so i’ll have to move schools, which’d mean i’d lose my closest friends in real life.

Im pretty much failing every class, flunking every class, i don’t do work anymore, im constantly in pain. My head thumps everyday with migraines and i cant focus, i can only stay sane from my dogs and music. Im in love with videogames, but my pc died last september so i havent been able to play and it made me really sad. 

I just want some incentive to live, to keep going, but i cant see anything but my future going dim. I’m in school typing this out. Im hoping by some insane luck that i can make it through this. I promised myself that depending how my year started out, i’d contemplate suicide. I decided that i would do it in feb but didnt, so i want to do it today. Idk how i’ll make it through this. Please, someone, help me.Im 14 and struggling a lot."

,SuicideWatch,"Hello everyone,

I just don't know where to start... I'm feeling really helpless to be honest. I feel like a burden, like a parasite. Every day, pain is with me. Joy is temporary. I surrender at this point. My childhood has been a mess with my dysfunctional parents. I've never been good. If you want to have an idea, my mother has a borderline personality disorder, which means she was violent, physically and emotionally. My father is narcissistic, he abused me emotionally, making me feel like a burden. Never keeping his promises. I've never been happy for a long time with them. I'd say, for my life, 10% happy, 90% in pain. Now I'm 21, I don't know how I survived at this point, but I reached my limit. I tried to take my life away, wasn't a success. My family learned it, and for a moment I thought they finally considered me, but it was for such a short amount of time. I'm always walking on eggs with my parents. I'm in university right now, and it's hard. I just don't have the energy and will to persevere. My energy level is low, very low. I've tried therapy, meds, taking walks, doing sports. But every time I feel like I finally got my life together, something happens and it goes down. For example, I thought I could have some hope two weeks ago, then my cat died. She was my real family, I really loved her and she was always there for me, she kinda helped me a lot with her caring presence. It destroyed me. Then I tried again, but now I've got issues again with the parents. I'm exhausted. I don't have the strength to continue this life. I'm helpless. I sincerely considered ending everything this week.

I tried to take my life away, wasn&amp;#39;t a success. My family learned it, and for a moment I thought they finally considered me, but it was for such a short amount of time. I&amp;#39;m always walking on eggs with my parents. I&amp;#39;m in university right now, and it&amp;#39;s hard. I just don&amp;#39;t have the energy and will to persevere. My energy level is low, very low. I&amp;#39;ve tried therapy, meds, taking walks, doing sports. But every time I feel like I finally got my life together, something happens and it goes down. For example, I thought I could have some hope two weeks ago, then my cat died. She was my real family, I really loved her and she was always there for me, she kinda helped me a lot with her caring presence. It destroyed me.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello. Never really wrote about myself online but I’m very curious and the stigma behind death seems to discourage discussion of it. I’ve actively tried talking to my family and a therapist about my perception of my life but their inability to understand that it does not and never has stemmed from depression irritates me. 

I want to die. I believe that death is the ultimate end goal for every single human being and rapidly increasing its approach would lead me to the end. Please note, I have a social life. I have close friends at college and at work. I also have a pretty active socia life (I go to a couple parties here and there). I’m in a solid relationship (been together for two years now), and I do not abuse drugs or alcohol, only at kick backs or something. I do not have depression, I’m pretty laid back down to earth guy who has never had any mental illness nor any thoughts of worthlessness, extreme sadness etc. 

Personally, the meaningless within life is the main motivator for my methodology. Realistically, the now is true living (due to its value, the past you can’t change and the future is unknown). Past the now, life is to be, not happening. Work, sex, love, entertainment, etc. are used to keep individuals living but what for? We work a 9-5 job, we have kids, we do all of these things and yet the reasoning boils down to survival and entertainment. entertainment to keep us looped within an endless cycle of netflix shows or games or tv shows or youtube and survival of work to eat and feed the future generation. realistically, love is a chemical compound effect which sparks to motivate the production of kids. to continue the species. the love of a parent to a child is to prevent child hood death so the child can become a parent and produce more children for the cycle to continue. when you really boil down what life is it’s just an endless cycle of continuation within a species. 

Idk i’m just curious if anyone else feels this way. You develop your own meaning in life but that meaning isn’t even yours. You are taught that meaning through society and social interactions. Your parents develop that meaning for you and you believe it’s yours but in reality it isn’t. The pursuit of a good job or a big house or to produce music or to be a serial killer all of these perceptions you learn from society in which you incorporate into your definition of life. how you want to live isn’t even your own perception it’s just a jumble of social expectations mixed into you.

We work a 9-5 job, we have kids, we do all of these things and yet the reasoning boils down to survival and entertainment. entertainment to keep us looped within an endless cycle of netflix shows or games or tv shows or youtube and survival of work to eat and feed the future generation. realistically, love is a chemical compound effect which sparks to motivate the production of kids. to continue the species. the love of a parent to a child is to prevent child hood death so the child can become a parent and produce more children for the cycle to continue. when you really boil down what life is it’s just an endless cycle of continuation within a species. 

Idk i’m just curious if anyone else feels this way. You develop your own meaning in life but that meaning isn’t even yours. You are taught that meaning through society and social interactions. Your parents develop that meaning for you and you believe it’s yours but in reality it isn’t. The pursuit of a good job or a big house or to produce music or to be a serial killer all of these perceptions you learn from society in which you incorporate into your definition of life. how you want to live isn’t even your own perception it’s just a jumble of social expectations mixed into you.

If anyone can help me understand this it’d be a great help. I just want to know why life has meaning and why we live if not for social pressures, a biological barrier which prevents self harm, your “personal” meaning, etc.I want to pursue death but I am not depressed nor suicidal"

I had a nightmare about this and I remembered all my father told me and his family when I was kid. I could not take it anymore. I really want to die. I dont really have a purpose on my life. I dont know why I should life. I have my life and I hate myself.I had a nightmare last night about my past"

,SuicideWatch,"Similar story here, OP. In my case my dad spent my childhood promising to *help* me pursue a science career if I moved in with him, along with many other exorbitant promises. He then coaxed me into signing my life savings over to him under the guise of him teaching me money management skills. Afterwards his personality instantly changed like he had been replaced with a body snatcher:

He started holding my money hostage to control me. He forced me into a flat earth fundamentalist church. He started incessantly discouraging my scientific interests. I was forbidden from me from even being seen with a girl since it might lead others to think we were sexually active. He threatened to cut me off if I ever associated with members of so many demographics that I was functionally unable to have friends. He would scream at me and belittle and humiliate me for hours every day. His church was so strict that I had to give up most of my hobbies for being ""sinful"". He tried to damage my relationships with all of my other family members. He would constantly follow me around and would incessantly act out for attention so much that I struggled to even attempt my schoolwork or even my remaining hobbies. I was quickly so psychologically broken that I started failing my classes despite growing up an honors student. 

A few years later, I took on a second major hoping to raise my GPA and just barely squeak into grad school. Dad took this to somehow mean that I was ""on the verge of graduating with two PhDs"". He completely flipped from incessantly discouraging me to exerting 24/7 pressure to graduate with those two PhDs *immediately*. I explained over and over that I wasn't getting two PhDs, but he wouldn't accept it. Despite my protests he spread word far and wide about my ""two PhDs"" and I gained a reputation as some kind of miracle prodigy that I could never actually live up to. By this point Dad was in the final stages of terminal heart problems and was so relentless in his pressure that I started going along with it because even after all his years of lies and abuse I didn't want to disappoint him on his death bed.

Years went by and things continued to get worse for me. I was overwhelmed with preemptive grief over dad's impending death every day. I went through a traumatic religious deconversion and lost my soul-sustaining (nonfundamentalist) faith in God. I started experiencing severe diabetes symptoms. I was struggling with the increased course load and failing to recover my grades as Dad continued to sink deeper and deeper into an obsession with those completely imaginary PhDs. One day dad started taking me to visit some old man from his crazy cult who was bedridden from his own terminal heart problems. 

More years went by and both dad and the old guy were both alive. That meant that Dad had been in the final stages of terminal illness for something like 6 years. I realized that he had been outrageously exaggerating his health problems and that I had spent the last several of them going along with his delusional nonsense

,SuicideWatch,"For years ive been depressed and taking medication. The one thing keeping me going has been my familys encouragement and love. All my life i grew up to please my parents and do what they wanted. I realised later on that i couldnt keep doing that. I tried to kill myself then but was caught. Its been five years since then and my parents have been so loving. They tell me they dont care what i will be in the future as long as im happy. And that was what kept me going. 

A few days ago i found out from my brother that our dad told him that he compares us to the other kids his officemates boast about. He says he cant help it. He says he knows its wrong but that we cant blame him. He says he went wrong with us. With me. It shattered me

Now as im writing this, i have almost everythimg ready to go tomorrow. The last time i wa s going to die i was desperate and grieving. Now im angry and sad and theres nothing left. No matter what option i have left. I will fail. I will never be what my parents love and are proud of. They lied to me all these 5 years. I know they love me. But now i know they pity me and think im a defect produced by their parenting. 

If anyone i know finds this, please know its not your fault. I will never hate anyone more than myself. Im a coward. ive always known. To my brother, i want you to have everything i own. You can choose to throw it away or give it away. The plushies can go to dad, the makeup can go to mom. The clothes can be sold. The rest is yours. Im sorry i couldnt be the sister you admire

Thank you to everyone who inspired me and encouraged me to live on. Im sorry. Its not your fault. Its all mine.

I've been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for about half my life, since I was in middle school. Had a couple close calls, but had my first genuine attempt last summer. I've been in and out of various treatments since then. Lost my job and most of my friends. Buried in medical debt. Lost my car today.

I can't keep myself sober, and, frankly, I'm out of reasons to bother trying. I like to say I won't make another attempt because of my dad, but some days I think the real reason is because I just haven't stockpiled enough pills yet.

,SuicideWatch,"I can't fcking take this any longer, this post probably won't help me much but I'm so desperate that I'll try anything to have a glimpse of hope. I'm so confused that I can't even write a proper text begging for help, a very simple act can become so complex and overwhelming to me.  
I'll try to write this as coherent as possible but since english isn't my main language and I seem to have lost all my intelligence, so please forgive me if It starts getting confusing.

So basically, I have no idea what to do, my depression is getting so bad that I don't see any other way out besides ending it all. I feel no pleasure what so ever, not even masturbating gives me any pleasure. I feel like shit on a daily basis, from overwhelming sadness, anxiety and rage to paranoia, overwhelming suicidal thoughts and even homicidal thoughts. I don't want to hurt anyone besides myself thought. I'm such a failure, I'm 18 and still a virgin, I'm fat and all the freaking times I joined the gym I found myself just giving up weeks later. I have no social skills, or better yet no skills AT ALL. All my life I was illuded by my teachers, parents and friends into thinking that I was smarter than average, and the worst thing is that was the only good thing I saw on me, but I'm not smart at all, I'm just a dumb piece of shit. I tried everything I could to treat my depression but nothing seems to work, meditation (minimum of 30 minutes per day), medication (multiple antipsychotics, antidepressants and benzodiazepines), psychedelic drugs (LSD, magic mushrooms, DMT, you name it I probably tried it). I go to a psychologist and psychiatrist but I feel no better, probably worse than when it all started, the worst part is that I don't even remember when and how it started. Now I wouldn't say I abuse drugs that much, I mainly smoke a bit of weed every now and then, mostly weekends, and regarding psychedelics I done them rarely and with every bit of damage reduction I could think of, perhaps I did indeed disrespect them a bit (mostly taking them without prior planning leading to uncomfortable sets and settings) since I can't enjoy them anymore, I panic and my mind instantly tells me to take xanax or any benzo I can get my hands on. However I DID abuse Xanax, so much so that I ended up on the hospital a couple times for taking too much of it and blacking out, while in school which just fucked my reputation in school. My friends tried to help me as much as they could, but my mind is so fucked and confused that nothing seems to help. This text is getting long but I still have so much to say, I'll try to not make it too long so you don't get bored quickly. My grades are down the hill, I'm currently in 12th grade and about to fail, and honestly I CAN'T stand another year at that school, I rather hang myself than go through that again, specially since I live in an isolated island in the middle of nowhere and resources are very limited here, there's nothing to do here and there's no chance I'm getting a girlfriend here (or anywhere to be honest, nobody would love a fat piece of shit like me).

Life is unbearable, I see no reason to stay alive, all I do all day is playing fcking LoL and let me tell you I hate that game so much, makes my blood boil and gives me urges to just cut my wrists. I can't make basic math/physics/chemistry/etc.. which just makes me feel even worst, cuz I need it to get to college, but I don't understand shit in school, since I can't study or focus, my mind just bombards me with horrible thoughts that echo in my mind till I put myself to sleep, I have no control over my mind anymore. I started learning guitar, and ended up giving up. I tried to learn how to program, but It's too overwhelming and I'm starting to lose any motivation I had for it (not that I had much motivation in general).

Here's some backstory, when I was a kid I got shot in my eye with a air pressure carabine, which left me with about 10% vision on said eye, made me get fat cuz I couldn't do exercise for about 2-3 years and I ended up getting a bad lifestyle in general, all day in computer playing games. This combined with more trauma I went throught and my midly toxic family, lead to me becoming the disgusting person I could think of. I know this is getting too much information and confusing please forgive me, I'm retarded.

Right now all I can think of is how to kill myself, I've tried it before with pills but ended up failing, so this time I'm thinking of hanging myself, and will do it eventually.

,SuicideWatch,"I’ve been combatting them for years and they are so strong they prevent me from being a functional member of society. I’ve (sort of) attempted suicide twice within the last 8 years. And I wish I just went more balls deep with it when I did. 

I’ve been inpatient in mental hospitals, I’ve done IOP programs, PHP programs, DBT, CBT, etc. for over 13 years and even after following all of these things I’ve learned, the suicidal thoughts always win.

,SuicideWatch,"I dont know what to do anymore. I was 4 months away from getting married to my best friend of 10 yrs! He says he doesn't know what he wants . Everything was fine. He was actively planning the wedding with me, calling me his fiancee and handing out save the dates. He says he needs time, so I left the house and next week it'll be 1 month of our separation. Everyone is saying ""its better that it happened now vs later"" but it still hurts like hell. I ask for a reason to all of this and he says he doesnt know himself. He posts on instagram that he had to use 100% of his energy to let me go and that i will be happier with someone else. But the thing is I dont want anyone else and i will always choose him. I told him that and he doesnt say anything except not to push him. I love him so much and my heart feels like its going to explode and i feel like dying everyday! I know there are worse things that are happening in the world, and i feel stupid for saying this but i would rather die than to be without him. Not all relationships are perfect, yes we had our issues but we always found a way to work it out. This time around it really CAME OUT OF NO WHERE, it literally blindsided me. I feel crushed and i find myself just going through the motions as to not alarm my family, but I just cant do it anymore.

,SuicideWatch,"Hey guys,

so this is a throwaway account for reasons...

Anyways, I'm a freshman in high school and overall, I have pretty decent grades and I play violin (since preschool) and do sports. I have an extremely caring an overall amazing boyfriend, and an awesome friend who I basically consider as an older brother.

I have nothing to live for. My mother is verbally abusive, and when I call out for help with the few close friends I have left, she says I'm lying and she'll call me out and ruin my life. Now, I don't even know if I'm lying or not. If I am, just ignore this then. I really don't know anymore. Everyday, I'm so confused. I have no right to be proud of anything, and because I go to a really tough high school, often I don't have the time to practice violin (but I do a lot of competitions and honor orch, etc. so yeah not good) and yanno, college applications are coming up and I don't think I have anything to show. I do homework during class so I can finally relax during lunch, but I tell my mom I do homework during lunch to avoid getting my ass kicked. She compulsively checks my phone and reads my texts (more than I have my phone, her reason is that my parents bought it and not me), goes through my stuff and takes it, then tells me she did nothing of the sort, and yet I'm the crazy horrible reputation ruining liar here. I guess I don't even know if I am?

I'm just so tired of it all. I know that there's things to look forward to and live for, but I feel nothing for it. I've had suicidal thoughts and depression and whatever and my mom is saying I'm lying and making it up. I just don't know what to do, because even though I'm just a teenager, I could probably say my boyfriend is the only person I'd want to spend life with if things work out (I've dated before and so has he). But as of now, I'm giving everyone aneurysms or something dealing with me and getting mad at me. My violin and sports are doing basically nothing because I don't have time or energy and this generation is pretty damn good at this stuff. The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I know my boyfriend probably would have a really hard time dealing with the fact that I was gone, for a very long time. I've been debating ending the relationship to make it easier on him.

I'm sorry, I don't know what to ask of y'all. Just please help me. I'm talked out. I just don't know anymore. Everytime someone tries to help everything honestly just gets worse.

&lt;p&gt;so this is a throwaway account for reasons...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I&amp;#39;m a freshman in high school and overall, I have pretty decent grades and I play violin (since preschool) and do sports. I have an extremely caring an overall amazing boyfriend, and an awesome friend who I basically consider as an older brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have nothing to live for. My mother is verbally abusive, and when I call out for help with the few close friends I have left, she says I&amp;#39;m lying and she&amp;#39;ll call me out and ruin my life. Now, I don&amp;#39;t even know if I&amp;#39;m lying or not. If I am, just ignore this then. I really don&amp;#39;t know anymore. Everyday, I&amp;#39;m so confused. I have no right to be proud of anything, and because I go to a really tough high school, often I don&amp;#39;t have the time to practice violin (but I do a lot of competitions and honor orch, etc. so yeah not good) and yanno, college applications are coming up and I don&amp;#39;t think I have anything to show. I do homework during class so I can finally relax during lunch, but I tell my mom I do homework during lunch to avoid getting my ass kicked. She compulsively checks my phone and reads my texts (more than I have my phone, her reason is that my parents bought it and not me), goes through my stuff and takes it, then tells me she did nothing of the sort, and yet I&amp;#39;m the crazy horrible reputation ruining liar here.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just so tired of it all. I know that there&amp;#39;s things to look forward to and live for, but I feel nothing for it.

,SuicideWatch,"Last year I was a freshman in highshighschool. Near the end I was ready. I was gonna do it then one of the people told my mom and got me help. I told 3 people john, alex, and gabriel. Kohn said he would help me but lied. Alex did nothing and gabriel helped me. A few nights ago john texted me. This is our conversation.



John: I know you hate and despise me with a passion, But I must ask, Why? I just kinda needed some clearence. I'm not here to pick a fight with you, but to come to an understanding, So looks like u have spent 10 mins typing, I guess I can expect a bomb drop on me or som.

Me: I was on the verge of suicide and u said u would do something u promised and I hoped deep down someone would I was going to kill my fucking self on the 13 of july that year stab in the heart with a fuckin knife u promised me someone who I dispite all other judgement thought was a good if not the closest friend I had u did nothing u would've let me die it was gabriel the one who I thought wouldn't give a shit because of all the shit we went through it was him who got me the fucking help I hate u so fuck much so so much with all my fucking heart every muscle and bone and tendon and bit of flesh burns with hatred when i even think about u and the worst part is i cant unthink it I cant just forget an entire year cause I fuckin would forget u exist forget the entirety of 8th grade then some more u go around saying oh jay was just faking it he wanted the attention I was going to fuckin die and u were gonna sit there and watch with ur thumb up ur ass like some sorta fuckin beast of the fields then u come back to me and ask what I did wrong why do u hate me like that's a question then ur not even gonna say sorry u weren't just a shitty friend ur a shitty person and I made it my mission now to stop people from making the same mistake I did trusting u fuck I was a goddamn idiot but it doesn't even matter now I know where everyone stands when I asked them to pick a side a while back and they said they were with me only to lie and be with u I know now I only hate 3 things u Hitler and satan and u u didnt even do just that u hit ur brother u shot at me with a bb gun u hit my head with a bat and each time I tried to be a friend have someone by myside thought it would be u guess not then theres ur sarcasm again and I could keep going but ur rushing me so here


John: Well holy shit That was... Okay look man I'm honestly speechless But I need you to understand my perception I thought that you were just up to ur usual antics and I thought u were begging for attention, and I decided to not give you that attention. You aren't gonna believe me but I am honestly truly sorry if you felt and continue to feel this way I mean I never wanted any of this, I was led to believe that you had gone mad and I had to leave it at there Suicide is stupid by the way, I have considered that for myself in the past and I'm telling you it does not go well because those who have acted on that literally destroy their loved ones. You need to understand that I never wanted to hurt you in the way that you felt I just thought it was a bucket of bullshit, but I know realize you needed help Look I wanna clear the air here, I know you'll never consider me friend and that you hate my guts, but I want to make my peace with you and I want you to understand that I never hated you, and I am a man who believes in redemption There's nothing I can do, you clearly are a broken individual, I pray for your healing and I hope god watches you I hope that you seek help and that you talk to someone about this

Me: Horse shit

John: Ik that's what you think

Me: Need I continue Or do u wanna talk in person

John: Look man all I can say is god bless your soul, may his angels watch you, may you be free of this cursed darkness, and if you wanna talk in person I'm totally up for that

Me: Tomorrow freshman bathrooms by the commons around a lunch

John: I have a class I need to attend for and my schedule is kinda tight, but I could tomorrow morning at the main commons or som I believe you and I have a shared friend, Jake Maybe he could be present as we hash things out 

Me: No This is a u and me thing Fuck class

John: Of course, but listen if you wanna reach me, I'm around in the mornings or C lunch period

Me: Fuck that then

John: I kinda got fucked with the tardies rn so... I mean I'm open to discussing with you 

Me: Fuck ok 

John: I just need a time that works for both of us

Me: I'm just gonna say it all here

John: I can get on call if you like?

Me: Cant

John: Aight Then ig you just tell me here

Me: Shortened version 

Beginning of 9th grade I was completely alone u guys who were supposed to be my fuckin friends ran from me knew no one talked to no one only friend I had was jd and hes an ass on his own lowering my self esteem and all this went on for a month finally when I caught hold of u I invited u all to my birthday where everyone fucked off on their own leaving me once again alone to top that off all 3 of u alex gabriel and u tried to leave then homecoming where my past finally caught up to me I met someone we went on a date and it was ok I got to the house only to find some cunt who left the group who u took the place of and he told them everything about me how I hurt people without remorse and how I would so it again and how I was dangerous and shit they knew and I went with them they tried confronting me about it but I lied I hate liars and I lied to make that worse she was with someone else and I couldn't do shit about it when I go over to look for u bing notification everyone except me with the caption only friends I need or something I didnt have a ride home so I went back each question getting more and more personal until my dad came where I had to lie to him too and mom I knew I was alone then thought for a while then the idea slipped in for all but a second talked myself out ended the semester kicked out of 4 groups and our relationship starting to tear

Second half dad beat me mom beat me I wasnt doing well anywhere I went I was getting called a school shooter mick was getting away with everything and I was constantly at the bottom always mom thinks I'm gay humiliates me to the point of breaking down telling her I'm not only to find out later she didnt believe me start to lose friends over time get kicked out of sam billings table and im alone idea slips in I think on it for a bit longer before talking myself out again dad moves to Arizona leaving mom stressed jd convinces me I'm not a good person I give him a peice of my mind we dont talk for a bit I get in a fight lose and get made fun of for it the idea is set now stuck in my head I'm going to do this i need to mom humiliates me further but apologizes I know it's fake I say to myself I should probably tell the fuckers so they aren't blindsided gabriel snitches later that night and I have a difficult conversation with mom concerning my mental health I go to therapy over the summer

This year I come to school knowing jake over summer hoping I have at least lunch but no I no nobody I'm alone again I see Sam's tables broken up over schedules I say not again and assemble what I can every other persons telling me I'm gay kill myself or something I know I need to keep loving myself even if I'm alone then I get word that u were telling people I  was saying I was going to kill myself for attention then the switch flipped I hate u always will I will never forgive u gabriel or alex never I bullshat my way into Jake's friend Austin's life stayed there expanded my group 

Now after thinking to myself why I'm even trying I realize u dont care ur a self centered asshole I had my fair share of toxicity but u took the cake and it was my fault for inviting u to the table now I see some freshman showing the same mannerisms as u and I know I need to stop it because u were a good friend but then u stopped and I dont understand that I don't get it why it doesn't matter the only one u care about is u and u will do anything to make sure u are ok or u come out on top like u have been but it doesn't matter I have the first real friend I had in a while a trustworthy group of friends and a gf lifes uphill only problem is u and I'm stuck on that cant shake it u aren't a good person idk if its u lashing out because of the divorce or u just think ur better than others or what anyways every part of my body wants u to burn in hell 
If that's too much to read listen to creep humility and magic city

John: I finished it all It was alot but I read it I don't what to say So you think I'm some narcisstic prick So much self pity man, and I have to say this really isnt healthy 

Me: Typical I said what I had to

John: You may not be able to forgive me, but you need to understand that this is not how any human being should live I wouldnt wish how you feel on my worst enemy

Me: I look for the good in everything I cant find any in u I said what i had to

John: I know Again you may think I'm some prideful narcisstic son on a bitch, but I do care about people, especially for those who are broken

Me: U are Look in a mirror and think long and hard about urself

John: I mean thats only how you view me There are millions of ways different people who see you You think I'm a bad man, and I accept your thoughts, I mean thats not who I am, but if thats the picture you painted then I'm sorry

Me: I'm an asshole that's how 80% of people see me and I'm ok with that But ask any one

John: My advice to you is find a light, be free, never let the pain, the darkness determine who you are

Me: Tell them answer honestly Dont therapize me

John: I'm happy that you met Jake, he is a truly great friend and is very supportive, I'm glad that you have someone like him in your life

Me: Fuck off with ur therapeutic bullshit

John: I'm not being your therapist, but the more you hang on to this hate and anger, than life will just be a major bummer I mean ur stubborn man

Me: Thing is I want to forgive and forget But I cant

John: And you can Thats ur choice

Me: U may be sorry now

John: U can let go of it all

Me: But that doesn't fix what ubdid U did*

John: What I did? Its all in ur head

Me:  I will never forgive u

John: You painted this fucked up picture of me

Me: Or alex Or gabriel I will not because theres no good in u We all see ourselves as saints and our enemies as devils

John: I'm not your enemy

Me: To me ur just the shittyiest of shitty people U are John U are

John: Than thats a u problem

Me: U were about to let me die After u promised to be with me Then u lie

John: First of all suicide is an option and I never advised you to do that

Me: I told u And gabriel And alex Only u 3

John: What was I supposed to do?  Did you want me to call a hotline or som?

Me: U were supposed to be my friend Just be my friend But u didnt and u cant and u won't

John: I wanted to be your friend, and I'm sorry that I decided to not even say anything That I took ur claims as an attention stunt

Me: U say sorry now because I explained U arent Dont kid urself 

John: Your in a dark dark place, and I feel very sorry for you, your broken and fucked up and all I can do is wish you the best Jay

Me: Were I'm not anymore I was in a dark place Things are fucked up Yes but that's gonna help later Gammbette jay gammbette and be kensuki Words I tell myself every morning Gammbette do your best in try in Japanese Kensuki the art of using gold to repair broken things Ik I'm broken but I'm fixing myself Something I would recommend u do

John: I'm happy for you

Me: No u fuckin aren't

John: Think what you want

Me: I can almost smell the bullshit Its alarming

John: Well again thats a u issue Nothing I can do about that

Me: I can't do shit about that Change my view I'm just gonna let u know rn I mean every word I say

John: So ig we are not on good terms? And cannot change it

Me: I hate u and cant forgive u I'm sorry But what you did to me I cant forgive

John: Take care of yourself Jay, I hope you find your inner peace, I hope you can achieve your nirvana Goodbye

Near the end I was ready. I was gonna do it then one of the people told my mom and got me help. I told 3 people john, alex, and gabriel. Kohn said he would help me but lied. Alex did nothing and gabriel helped me. A few nights ago john texted me. This is our conversation.



John: I know you hate and despise me with a passion, But I must ask, Why? I just kinda needed some clearence. I'm not here to pick a fight with you, but to come to an understanding, So looks like u have spent 10 mins typing, I guess I can expect a bomb drop on me or som.

Me: I was on the verge of suicide and u said u would do something u promised and I hoped deep down someone would I was going to kill my fucking self on the 13 of july that year stab in the heart with a fuckin knife u promised me someone who I dispite all other judgement thought was a good if not the closest friend I had u did nothing u would've let me die it was gabriel the one who I thought wouldn't give a shit because of all the shit we went through it was him who got me the fucking help I hate u so fuck much so so much with all my fucking heart every muscle and bone and tendon and bit of flesh burns with hatred when i even think about u and the worst part is i cant unthink it I cant just forget an entire year cause I fuckin would forget u exist forget the entirety of 8th grade then some more u go around saying oh jay was just faking it he wanted the attention I was going to fuckin die and u were gonna sit there and watch with ur thumb up ur ass like some sorta fuckin beast of the fields then u come back to me and ask what I did wrong why do u hate me like that's a question then ur not even gonna say sorry u weren't just a shitty friend ur a shitty person and I made it my mission now to stop people from making the same mistake I did trusting u fuck I was a goddamn idiot but it doesn't even matter now I know where everyone stands when I asked them to pick a side a while back and they said they were with me only to lie and be with u I know now I only hate 3 things u Hitler and satan and u u didnt even do just that u hit ur brother u shot at me with a bb gun u hit my head with a bat and each time I tried to be a friend have someone by myside thought it would be u guess not then theres ur sarcasm again and I could keep going but ur rushing me so here


John: Well holy shit That was... Okay look man I'm honestly speechless But I need you to understand my perception I thought that you were just up to ur usual antics and I thought u were begging for attention, and I decided to not give you that attention. You aren't gonna believe me but I am honestly truly sorry if you felt and continue to feel this way I mean I never wanted any of this, I was led to believe that you had gone mad and I had to leave it at there Suicide is stupid by the way, I have considered that for myself in the past and I'm telling you it does not go well because those who have acted on that literally destroy their loved ones. You need to understand that I never wanted to hurt you in the way that you felt I just thought it was a bucket of bullshit, but I know realize you needed help Look I wanna clear the air here, I know you'll never consider me friend and that you hate my guts, but I want to make my peace with you and I want you to understand that I never hated you, and I am a man who believes in redemption There's nothing I can do, you clearly are a broken individual, I pray for your healing and I hope god watches you I hope that you seek help and that you talk to someone about this

Me: Horse shit

John: Ik that's what you think

Me: Need I continue Or do u wanna talk in person

John: Look man all I can say is god bless your soul, may his angels watch you, may you be free of this cursed darkness, and if you wanna talk in person I'm totally up for that

Me: Tomorrow freshman bathrooms by the commons around a lunch

John: I have a class I need to attend for and my schedule is kinda tight, but I could tomorrow morning at the main commons or som I believe you and I have a shared friend, Jake Maybe he could be present as we hash things out 

Me: No This is a u and me thing Fuck class

John: Of course, but listen if you wanna reach me, I'm around in the mornings or C lunch period

Me: Fuck that then

John: I kinda got fucked with the tardies rn so... I mean I'm open to discussing with you 

Me: Fuck ok 

John: I just need a time that works for both of us

Me: I'm just gonna say it all here

John: I can get on call if you like?

Me: Cant

John: Aight Then ig you just tell me here

Me: Shortened version 

Beginning of 9th grade I was completely alone u guys who were supposed to be my fuckin friends ran from me knew no one talked to no one only friend I had was jd and hes an ass on his own lowering my self esteem and all this went on for a month finally when I caught hold of u I invited u all to my birthday where everyone fucked off on their own leaving me once again alone to top that off all 3 of u alex gabriel and u tried to leave then homecoming where my past finally caught up to me I met someone we went on a date and it was ok I got to the house only to find some cunt who left the group who u took the place of and he told them everything about me how I hurt people without remorse and how I would so it again and how I was dangerous and shit they knew and I went with them they tried confronting me about it but I lied I hate liars and I lied to make that worse she was with someone else and I couldn't do shit about it when I go over to look for u bing notification everyone except me with the caption only friends I need or something I didnt have a ride home so I went back each question getting more and more personal until my dad came where I had to lie to him too and mom I knew I was alone then thought for a while then the idea slipped in for all but a second talked myself out ended the semester kicked out of 4 groups and our relationship starting to tear

Second half dad beat me mom beat me I wasnt doing well anywhere I went I was getting called a school shooter mick was getting away with everything and I was constantly at the bottom always mom thinks I'm gay humiliates me to the point of breaking down telling her I'm not only to find out later she didnt believe me start to lose friends over time get kicked out of sam billings table and im alone idea slips in I think on it for a bit longer before talking myself out again dad moves to Arizona leaving mom stressed jd convinces me I'm not a good person I give him a peice of my mind we dont talk for a bit I get in a fight lose and get made fun of for it the idea is set now stuck in my head I'm going to do this i need to mom humiliates me further but apologizes I know it's fake I say to myself I should probably tell the fuckers so they aren't blindsided gabriel snitches later that night and I have a difficult conversation with mom concerning my mental health I go to therapy over the summer

This year I come to school knowing jake over summer hoping I have at least lunch but no I no nobody I'm alone again I see Sam's tables broken up over schedules I say not again and assemble what I can every other persons telling me I'm gay kill myself or something I know I need to keep loving myself even if I'm alone then I get word that u were telling people I  was saying I was going to kill myself for attention then the switch flipped I hate u always will I will never forgive u gabriel or alex never I bullshat my way into Jake's friend Austin's life stayed there expanded my group

,SuicideWatch,"I'm nearly 23 years old. My father abandoned our family when I was 14. He was my best friend at the time... I haven't seen him in 6 years. This void made me become extremely close to my few friends. My clinginess reached a point where they got fed up from me and my anxiety and paranoia, that I've now lost my closest friends. I used to reach out to them for help, but it reached a point where everything was on their shoulders and they couldn't handle it anymore, so they distanced themselves with time.  
I used to be more fit and more attractive, but my life has taken a downwards spiral. I've gained about 70 lbs and my self-consciousness eats me up on the inside. My anxiety is through the roof and I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I'm on anxiety meds but truly think I should be on anti-depressants. I am now failing out of school and I don't have the heart to tell my mother. It will break her, but also I know that once she finds out, my life will probably turn into more of a hell, as she's always had extremely high standards for me. 

I'm still a virgin. I've never had a girlfriend. I was seeing this girl when I was 17, but that was about it. And that was at my peak attractiveness. It is now laughable how unattractive I am.

I have no ambitions. I don't know what I want to do in life. Everyone around me seems to have it figured out. Meanwhile, I'm a loser that is eating his life away.

He doesn't believe our relationship is sustainable, and he can't promise he won't one day be tempted to cheat, if he doesn't ""have this outlet.""  He won't marry me unless I can agree to the open relationship.  I'm a deeply monogamous person and just can't do it.  I can't.

He doesn't believe our relationship is sustainable, and he can't promise he won't one day be tempted to cheat, if he doesn't ""have this outlet.""  He won't marry me unless I can agree to the open relationship.  I'm a deeply monogamous person and just can't do it.  I can't.

I never believed that anyone could love me; I have multiple sclerosis and am trans, along with a ton of other issues.  He has made me so happy, and I felt so loved and secure, just to learn that he isn't satisfied with me and never will be.  As I always feared, I'm just not good enough.

We're in couples counseling, he wants to make things work somehow, but I can't see any possible solution even though I want nothing more than him.  I hate my body more than ever before.  I hate myself.

I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 20 years.  I believe this was my last chance, and it is failing horribly, and I just don't have it in me to keep trying.The man I want to marry is breaking my heart and I just can't do this."
,SuicideWatch,"I’ve been *somewhat* suicidal myself. More so in the “Im in so much pain I want to stop existing” than having a plan to end it all kind of way. 

I love someone dearly who has attempted suicide more than once and been hospitalized after their attempts. They also struggle with addiction.

I’ve also lost someone I love to suicide. 

They’ve called me, more than once, often drunk or high, sometimes not, telling me goodbye, this was the end, and this was their plan (I don’t know if specific phrases are allowed, so to generalize, the gist is I have all I need to kill myself readily accessible/I am in the location where I’m going to kill my self and when we hang up I’m going to do it) 

Sometimes, I’m close enough that I can physically go to be with them. Sometimes I’m not. 

Every time, I feel like their life is in my hands. That’s not a responsibility I feel like I can handle. If something were to happen to them, I’d feel entirely responsible. 

I feel like I’ve read so much that suggestions to seek professional help aren’t helpful and the last thing to do is call the police or emergency services... but I am so scared. I love my friend and I want them to know it. I want them to know how truly I support them and don’t blame them for what they’re feeling or think they’re doing anything wrong. Because I truly don’t.

It would be different if it wasn’t an active plan. I’m comfortable with I want to die sentiments.

,SuicideWatch,"After 29 years of being a shut in, sometimes having social anxiety so bad that I couldn't step out my house or go near the windows, mental health so bad that i couldn't work or finish school, I decided to go back to school. I'm dependent on a longtime SO and it makes me feel awful. There have been elements of abuse in the past and I dont think I can fully trust anyone, so I have to do this or die or get a high paying job without a degree or hurting my back(I have a terrible back and neurological problems) I'll be left with something like stripping, or just suicide.

&amp;nbsp;

At this point, classes are getting more intense, I'm already behind in an online class that posted no deadlines, because I'm prioritizing a class in which I work around 30 hours/week to keep my quality high(I'm aiming for A's and this class is supposedly graded harshly-so far I have A's and 1 B on something I worked on for just 10 hours). Anyway, so I am behind in my online classes now, trying to make time to catch up, but seems impossible.  

&amp;nbsp;

My other in person class doesn't take as much time, I have a 4 hour studio and homework takes me maybe 1-5 hours usually. I have trouble managing time because I hardly see my SO, so when we do see each other, we stay up late and just play games. We havent had any intimacy in about a month, and otherwise it's like a 1-2x/month thing. He doesn't help me with the chores unless I ask a bunch of times even though i made a chore chart for us both to look at,on the fridge, and gave myself more things. He keeps promising he'll do chores,shower,brush his teeth, just basic things, and he doesn't. He actually said he'd do all the chores when I went back to school(like I'd done for him) and not to worry. I worried, but I left things for a bit and realized I was correct in being concerned after the house started looking trashed. If I talk to him he changes the topic or recites some meme. He kisses me maybe twice a day and is otherwise glued to his phone watching YouTube videos- he quit video games as they were time consuming but just switched to videos instead. He's so addicted to his phone that he got his by a bus last year, while I was passenger. He's usually on his phone while driving and there's nothing I can do. I dont drive because of my anxiety, and I dont have a working car. I am very stressed right now and feel totally alone. 
&amp;nbsp;

I literally dont have time to see a therapist. I dont even have time to see my doctors for checkups. All I do is work, at school,homework,and at home. I am painfully shy and awkward and have no friends. I've joined a few clubs to make friends but it seems impossible; people try to befriend me it seems, and I just don't know how to interact.  I had an amazing conversation with another top performer in my class with the difficult work and anticipated becoming friends- she tries, but I dont know how to reciprocate and I can tell that I make things uncomfortable because I react as if we never started forming a friendship, if that makes sense. 

&amp;nbsp;

In my other class there is one kid who has tried to befriend me. He has autism and comes across pretty brash. I try to remind myself that he has a condition and to not take things personally, but sometimes I can't help it and I feel terrible and other times he is just too close and I feel awkward. I think he seems genuinely friendly and most of the time I dont mind him, but I guess I'm just under so much stress at this point that everything is getting to me. The whole class is also pretty distracting, which again, is usually bearable but the stress is wearing me out and there's 0 things I can do to relieve it.

&amp;nbsp;

Yesterday I got a grade back from a quiz and just a friendly note to try to speak up more during critique(I'm a design student, so this is an art class). I made a mental note to make sure to speak up during critique last night, and then I panicked. First I panicked because I wanted to be done my painting beforehand- I hadn't planned properly and am always the slow one in everything, so I kept messing up and didn't finish in time. It seemed I was one of 2 others who hadn't finished so that made me feel a little better. Critique came and the aforementioned kid stood next to me as he always does, uncomfortably close, and then in front of me and I couldn't see the paintings. Panic increased and I didn't want to be rude so I didn't say anything. I planned for what shouldve been my painting for critique and was called out of order and further panicked. 
&amp;nbsp;

I have a disorder that causes dissociation under stress and I have social anxiety. So when I panic, my mind goes blank. This happened a few days ago; my dog is unfortunately aggressive with 1 dog in my neighborhood. She is a strong dog and fortunately until this point, it had only been my bf who had experienced this. She lunged at the dog and I wasnt strong enough to pull her back, I panicked,mind went blank, and I just stood there. In my mind, the only thing i could think was like, the idea or feeling of alarm, but I couldn't speak or move. The neighbor didn't seem to mind and gave the dogs treats, but I felt so terrible. I don't know how to fix this.

&amp;nbsp;

During the critique, my mind was blank and I didn't know what to say. I absorbed things others had said, but my mind flushed them out when I tried to speak. Speaking and thinking at the same time is difficult for me. I guess I'm just stupid. I usually think for a long time before I speak, and I can think and write, but I dont know how to think+speak quickly or at once. I just felt like crying and couldn't wait to just pack up and start on my drawing assignment(until I realized I'd forgotten my most important supplies).

&amp;nbsp;

I grew up with abusive parents. My dad was pretty absent, working a lot, but when he was home he was a complete ass. He would constantly provoke me. My older brother harshly picked on me. My mom did the most damage, somehow. I grew up thinking she was ""good cop"", she taught me to think that. She could do no wrong, she was perfect, she was always right. If she was upset with me, even if seemingly unreasonable, I did mental gymnastics with myself to justify it. Example: I didn't intervene in her argument with my dad over finances which 6 year old me didn't understand? I'm a bad person who doesn't love mom. 
Moms in the bathroom the 8th time this week with razor blades? I'd be her psychiatrist and beg her to come out,reason with her why she should. Eventually I realized I didn't have to say anything. Eventually still, I realized that I could probably leave because she would just come out soon anyway. I did once, around 6 or 7 and I guess she talked and I didn't respond, so she came literally running after me, cornered me, and yelled down at me for not loving her.
&amp;nbsp;
I have an eating disorder? 
I'm ""evil"", I'm a ""dirty slut"" even though I'm not allowed out of the house- this must be because of how I look or something I've done- am I that person? Mom says so, so i guess so. 
&amp;nbsp;
As a young child, I was mostly raised by my grandparents nextdoor and would sleep over at their house often. I'd cry myself to sleep every night because I thought my mom was mad at me. Every day, I'd be to blame for something. Once, I even got blamed for my dad losing $100. I don't even know why. My mom yelled from up at our back door to down at the yard at me, with the neighborhood kids all outside, telling me I'd better bring the $100 back right now. So then my friends assumed I was a thief(cause a 9 y/o who can't drive and never goes anywhere has a reason for money is definitely wont get caught with random money at some point 🙄). 

&amp;nbsp;

At some point, around 9, I started self harming because I didn't understand what I had apparently done. I was upset for always being such an apparent major cause of my mother's pain- the person I did love most in the world no matter what she thought.

&amp;nbsp;

My parents destroyed my education as an ongoing argument for the funsies I guess. I planned to graduate at 15 or 16 and GTFO. I was physically bullied at school to the point of having my arms near broken every day. I begged to be homeschooled- my plan was to be able to focus on my schooling without bullies and graduate early to get away from my family. I was in 2nd grade my first year homeschooling and skipped up to grade 5 work in everything but math, which I got up to maybe grade 3 which was equivalent to my current grade in public school work. My parents would argue about public and homeschooling and switch me back and forth at least once a school semester. So I'd be in public school in august for a few months, then homeschooled. Obviously this ruined my extra work I'd done and I became discouraged. In 7th grade, I began having a lot of trouble with math. My mom refused to help me, saying I had learning disability and just couldn't learn so to not do it(and then help my lovely, psychotic step sister instead). She'd do this to me at public school too, and I'd often go in humiliated having to explain that I couldn't finish my homework. 

&amp;nbsp;

At one point, I wasn't allowed outside(my grandparents had moved in) and due to that and all the stress, I embraced being reclusive. I told myself I wanted to be that way and whenever people would think it was odd, my mom would huff back at them before I could speak, saying that not everyone has to have friends.

&amp;nbsp;

And now I'm this. Looking back, I remember my dad telling me that my mom coddled me too much and kept me from other people, wanting me all to herself. At the time I thought it was ridiculous, but now I see he was right; she needed me to soothe her, to blame for everything, to be there in misery with her. 
&amp;nbsp;

I got older, decided that I wanted to try being social, so I'd say yes to every single opportunity. Every one. That was a terrible idea and I ended up being abused by a few predatory opportunists, which in turn caused me major anxiety, more than ever before, and I became more reclusive than ever before. I havent held a stable job in a while. Havent had friends since that time, about 10 years ago. I've been with my SO, who has been abusive off and on. Things were great for a few years until we moved out a few years ago, and now they've been very off and on. For a few years again, things have been pretty good as far as that goes, but obviously not having time and not feeling effort from the other person feels shitty too. 

&amp;nbsp;

A couple years ago I found myself in a terrible situation with him and decided my options were prostitution, stripping, drugs, or suicide. I mass applied to jobs but when I'd receive a response, I was never qualified for anything but retail which I've had bad experiences with and it doesn't pay enough. I stopped eating, became an alcoholic with the little funds I had, and attempted suicide somewhere near 3 times a week on average for a few months straight. I almost succeeded once and then my bf unexpectedly came home early and I was sent to the hospital. Things didn't get better when I got out, I threw away my antidepressants since my feelings felt inappropriate in relation to my thoughts and situation, and resumed weekly attempts. Otherwise I'd just lie in bed and try not to get up for fear of killing myself.

&amp;nbsp;

2017 and 2018 sucked. Last year got a little better and by the end of the year I decided to go back to school. I decided rather abruptly and didn't have time to seek diagnosis for learning disabilities, which I think I obviously have. I have a diagnosis of anxiety disorders and recurrent major depressive disorder but I've assumed I wouldn't receive any accommodations for those because.. what can be done?

&amp;nbsp;

Instead I've tried plowing through my feelings and intentionally making myself uncomfortable by joining clubs and going to campus in person, but I'm not adjusting as quickly as I'd hoped. And in the real world, I will have to talk, I will have to have social skills. No one cares about you in the real world. I'm old and have already exposed myself to that in the many job fields I've attempted, so I'm aware. 

&amp;nbsp;

I just feel like I'm a failure. And now I'm overloading myself and I dont want to back down, but idk how to deal with everything and get no help, and have nothing outside of school and working at home. I need a good balance, but I have literally no way of making that happen. I'm in a club that meets once a week, the paper which is 1x a month, and now a new club that no one showed up for, so I became club leader. This will force me into social situations, and I hope that I can do it. In my head I'm telling myself to just do it, so I try, and I talk, and garbage comes out. And I'm older than everyone else, so it's awkward. I'm not supposed to be so immature and stupid by social standards. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like I'm just not going to make it. I have straight A's but I feel like I don't deserve them. My art never looks good to me even after spending hours working. I need to make this work but I dont know how. I dont know how to change who I've been for 29 years, in an instant, but I desperately want to. I want to be different, I dont want to be who I am anymore. In the meantime, I'm trying to squeeze in time with my SO and getting very little sleep. Most of it is just time in the same room not even interacting or talking or anything and I feel really void of any affection and social interaction right now, as well as anything fun. I used to walk every day- it's something that lessens the frequency of nerve pain and I dont even have time for that. The weather has been shit anyway. I dont find gaming fun, I don't like to sit, but that's all I'm doing. I'm exhausted. 

&amp;nbsp;

I dont even know what I'm getting at anymore with this. I'm just frustrated with life. Everything is dull,I'm over stressed,lonely, and I honestly just hate myself. Everything about myself is awful, I really hate who I am. I became really sick in the first few weeks of school and have had bronchitis for about 3-4 weeks. It's getting better but I feel like that happening really fucked a lot up for me since I had no energy. I dont know how to manage everything or how to socialize. I feel like I should just kill myself but I dont know how to even do it properly in a way that wont be totally awful. I'm looking to get away from pain and if the last minutes of my life could at least be peaceful that would be, well, ideal. I really wish assisted suicide for chronically suicidal people was a thing sometimes.",t2_wt179fx,False,,0,False,Stress and loneliness are dragging me down again,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,False,t3_fdgalg,False,dark,,public,8,0,{},2a7b5518-8e45-11e5-a506-0ed10b342609,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,8,,False,,1583343330.0,modmsg,[],{},,True,,1583371279.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 29 years of being a shut in, sometimes having social anxiety so bad that I couldn&amp;#39;t step out my house or go near the windows, mental health so bad that i couldn&amp;#39;t work or finish school, I decided to go back to school. I&amp;#39;m dependent on a longtime SO and it makes me feel awful. There have been elements of abuse in the past and I dont think I can fully trust anyone, so I have to do this or die or get a high paying job without a degree or hurting my back(I have a terrible back and neurological problems) I&amp;#39;ll be left with something like stripping, or just suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, classes are getting more intense, I&amp;#39;m already behind in an online class that posted no deadlines, because I&amp;#39;m prioritizing a class in which I work around 30 hours/week to keep my quality high(I&amp;#39;m aiming for A&amp;#39;s and this class is supposedly graded harshly-so far I have A&amp;#39;s and 1 B on something I worked on for just 10 hours). Anyway, so I am behind in my online classes now, trying to make time to catch up, but seems impossible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other in person class doesn&amp;#39;t take as much time, I have a 4 hour studio and homework takes me maybe 1-5 hours usually. I have trouble managing time because I hardly see my SO, so when we do see each other, we stay up late and just play games. We havent had any intimacy in about a month, and otherwise it&amp;#39;s like a 1-2x/month thing. He doesn&amp;#39;t help me with the chores unless I ask a bunch of times even though i made a chore chart for us both to look at,on the fridge, and gave myself more things. He keeps promising he&amp;#39;ll do chores,shower,brush his teeth, just basic things, and he doesn&amp;#39;t. He actually said he&amp;#39;d do all the chores when I went back to school(like I&amp;#39;d done for him) and not to worry. I worried, but I left things for a bit and realized I was correct in being concerned after the house started looking trashed. If I talk to him he changes the topic or recites some meme. He kisses me maybe twice a day and is otherwise glued to his phone watching YouTube videos- he quit video games as they were time consuming but just switched to videos instead. He&amp;#39;s so addicted to his phone that he got his by a bus last year, while I was passenger. He&amp;#39;s usually on his phone while driving and there&amp;#39;s nothing I can do. I dont drive because of my anxiety, and I dont have a working car. I am very stressed right now and feel totally alone. 
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I literally dont have time to see a therapist. I dont even have time to see my doctors for checkups. All I do is work, at school,homework,and at home. I am painfully shy and awkward and have no friends. I&amp;#39;ve joined a few clubs to make friends but it seems impossible; people try to befriend me it seems, and I just don&amp;#39;t know how to interact.  I had an amazing conversation with another top performer in my class with the difficult work and anticipated becoming friends- she tries, but I dont know how to reciprocate and I can tell that I make things uncomfortable because I react as if we never started forming a friendship, if that makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my other class there is one kid who has tried to befriend me. He has autism and comes across pretty brash. I try to remind myself that he has a condition and to not take things personally, but sometimes I can&amp;#39;t help it and I feel terrible and other times he is just too close and I feel awkward. I think he seems genuinely friendly and most of the time I dont mind him, but I guess I&amp;#39;m just under so much stress at this point that everything is getting to me. The whole class is also pretty distracting, which again, is usually bearable but the stress is wearing me out and there&amp;#39;s 0 things I can do to relieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got a grade back from a quiz and just a friendly note to try to speak up more during critique(I&amp;#39;m a design student, so this is an art class). I made a mental note to make sure to speak up during critique last night, and then I panicked. First I panicked because I wanted to be done my painting beforehand- I hadn&amp;#39;t planned properly and am always the slow one in everything, so I kept messing up and didn&amp;#39;t finish in time. It seemed I was one of 2 others who hadn&amp;#39;t finished so that made me feel a little better. Critique came and the aforementioned kid stood next to me as he always does, uncomfortably close, and then in front of me and I couldn&amp;#39;t see the paintings. Panic increased and I didn&amp;#39;t want to be rude so I didn&amp;#39;t say anything. I planned for what shouldve been my painting for critique and was called out of order and further panicked. 
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a disorder that causes dissociation under stress and I have social anxiety. So when I panic, my mind goes blank. This happened a few days ago; my dog is unfortunately aggressive with 1 dog in my neighborhood. She is a strong dog and fortunately until this point, it had only been my bf who had experienced this. She lunged at the dog and I wasnt strong enough to pull her back, I panicked,mind went blank, and I just stood there. In my mind, the only thing i could think was like, the idea or feeling of alarm, but I couldn&amp;#39;t speak or move. The neighbor didn&amp;#39;t seem to mind and gave the dogs treats, but I felt so terrible. I don&amp;#39;t know how to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the critique, my mind was blank and I didn&amp;#39;t know what to say. I absorbed things others had said, but my mind flushed them out when I tried to speak. Speaking and thinking at the same time is difficult for me. I guess I&amp;#39;m just stupid. I usually think for a long time before I speak, and I can think and write, but I dont know how to think+speak quickly or at once. I just felt like crying and couldn&amp;#39;t wait to just pack up and start on my drawing assignment(until I realized I&amp;#39;d forgotten my most important supplies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up with abusive parents. My dad was pretty absent, working a lot, but when he was home he was a complete ass. He would constantly provoke me. My older brother harshly picked on me. My mom did the most damage, somehow. I grew up thinking she was &amp;quot;good cop&amp;quot;, she taught me to think that. She could do no wrong, she was perfect, she was always right. If she was upset with me, even if seemingly unreasonable, I did mental gymnastics with myself to justify it. Example: I didn&amp;#39;t intervene in her argument with my dad over finances which 6 year old me didn&amp;#39;t understand? I&amp;#39;m a bad person who doesn&amp;#39;t love mom. 
Moms in the bathroom the 8th time this week with razor blades? I&amp;#39;d be her psychiatrist and beg her to come out,reason with her why she should. Eventually I realized I didn&amp;#39;t have to say anything. Eventually still, I realized that I could probably leave because she would just come out soon anyway. I did once, around 6 or 7 and I guess she talked and I didn&amp;#39;t respond, so she came literally running after me, cornered me, and yelled down at me for not loving her.
&amp;nbsp;
I have an eating disorder? 
I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot;, I&amp;#39;m a &amp;quot;dirty slut&amp;quot; even though I&amp;#39;m not allowed out of the house- this must be because of how I look or something I&amp;#39;ve done- am I that person? Mom says so, so i guess so. 
&amp;nbsp;
As a young child, I was mostly raised by my grandparents nextdoor and would sleep over at their house often. I&amp;#39;d cry myself to sleep every night because I thought my mom was mad at me. Every day, I&amp;#39;d be to blame for something. Once, I even got blamed for my dad losing $100. I don&amp;#39;t even know why. My mom yelled from up at our back door to down at the yard at me, with the neighborhood kids all outside, telling me I&amp;#39;d better bring the $100 back right now. So then my friends assumed I was a thief(cause a 9 y/o who can&amp;#39;t drive and never goes anywhere has a reason for money is definitely wont get caught with random money at some point 🙄). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, around 9, I started self harming because I didn&amp;#39;t understand what I had apparently done. I was upset for always being such an apparent major cause of my mother&amp;#39;s pain- the person I did love most in the world no matter what she thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents destroyed my education as an ongoing argument for the funsies I guess. I planned to graduate at 15 or 16 and GTFO. I was physically bullied at school to the point of having my arms near broken every day. I begged to be homeschooled- my plan was to be able to focus on my schooling without bullies and graduate early to get away from my family. I was in 2nd grade my first year homeschooling and skipped up to grade 5 work in everything but math, which I got up to maybe grade 3 which was equivalent to my current grade in public school work. My parents would argue about public and homeschooling and switch me back and forth at least once a school semester. So I&amp;#39;d be in public school in august for a few months, then homeschooled. Obviously this ruined my extra work I&amp;#39;d done and I became discouraged. In 7th grade, I began having a lot of trouble with math. My mom refused to help me, saying I had learning disability and just couldn&amp;#39;t learn so to not do it(and then help my lovely, psychotic step sister instead). She&amp;#39;d do this to me at public school too, and I&amp;#39;d often go in humiliated having to explain that I couldn&amp;#39;t finish my homework. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point, I wasn&amp;#39;t allowed outside(my grandparents had moved in) and due to that and all the stress, I embraced being reclusive. I told myself I wanted to be that way and whenever people would think it was odd, my mom would huff back at them before I could speak, saying that not everyone has to have friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I&amp;#39;m this. Looking back, I remember my dad telling me that my mom coddled me too much and kept me from other people, wanting me all to herself. At the time I thought it was ridiculous, but now I see he was right; she needed me to soothe her, to blame for everything, to be there in misery with her. 
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got older, decided that I wanted to try being social, so I&amp;#39;d say yes to every single opportunity. Every one. That was a terrible idea and I ended up being abused by a few predatory opportunists, which in turn caused me major anxiety, more than ever before, and I became more reclusive than ever before. I havent held a stable job in a while. Havent had friends since that time, about 10 years ago. I&amp;#39;ve been with my SO, who has been abusive off and on. Things were great for a few years until we moved out a few years ago, and now they&amp;#39;ve been very off and on. For a few years again, things have been pretty good as far as that goes, but obviously not having time and not feeling effort from the other person feels shitty too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago I found myself in a terrible situation with him and decided my options were prostitution, stripping, drugs, or suicide. I mass applied to jobs but when I&amp;#39;d receive a response, I was never qualified for anything but retail which I&amp;#39;ve had bad experiences with and it doesn&amp;#39;t pay enough. I stopped eating, became an alcoholic with the little funds I had, and attempted suicide somewhere near 3 times a week on average for a few months straight. I almost succeeded once and then my bf unexpectedly came home early and I was sent to the hospital. Things didn&amp;#39;t get better when I got out, I threw away my antidepressants since my feelings felt inappropriate in relation to my thoughts and situation, and resumed weekly attempts. Otherwise I&amp;#39;d just lie in bed and try not to get up for fear of killing myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017 and 2018 sucked. Last year got a little better and by the end of the year I decided to go back to school. I decided rather abruptly and didn&amp;#39;t have time to seek diagnosis for learning disabilities, which I think I obviously have. I have a diagnosis of anxiety disorders and recurrent major depressive disorder but I&amp;#39;ve assumed I wouldn&amp;#39;t receive any accommodations for those because.. what can be done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead I&amp;#39;ve tried plowing through my feelings and intentionally making myself uncomfortable by joining clubs and going to campus in person, but I&amp;#39;m not adjusting as quickly as I&amp;#39;d hoped. And in the real world, I will have to talk, I will have to have social skills. No one cares about you in the real world. I&amp;#39;m old and have already exposed myself to that in the many job fields I&amp;#39;ve attempted, so I&amp;#39;m aware. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel like I&amp;#39;m a failure. And now I&amp;#39;m overloading myself and I dont want to back down, but idk how to deal with everything and get no help, and have nothing outside of school and working at home. I need a good balance, but I have literally no way of making that happen. I&amp;#39;m in a club that meets once a week, the paper which is 1x a month, and now a new club that no one showed up for, so I became club leader. This will force me into social situations, and I hope that I can do it. In my head I&amp;#39;m telling myself to just do it, so I try, and I talk, and garbage comes out. And I&amp;#39;m older than everyone else, so it&amp;#39;s awkward. I&amp;#39;m not supposed to be so immature and stupid by social standards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;m just not going to make it. I have straight A&amp;#39;s but I feel like I don&amp;#39;t deserve them. My art never looks good to me even after spending hours working. I need to make this work but I dont know how. I dont know how to change who I&amp;#39;ve been for 29 years, in an instant, but I desperately want to. I want to be different, I dont want to be who I am anymore. In the meantime, I&amp;#39;m trying to squeeze in time with my SO and getting very little sleep. Most of it is just time in the same room not even interacting or talking or anything and I feel really void of any affection and social interaction right now, as well as anything fun. I used to walk every day- it&amp;#39;s something that lessens the frequency of nerve pain and I dont even have time for that. The weather has been shit anyway. I dont find gaming fun, I don&amp;#39;t like to sit, but that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m doing. I&amp;#39;m exhausted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont even know what I&amp;#39;m getting at anymore with this. I&amp;#39;m just frustrated with life. Everything is dull,I&amp;#39;m over stressed,lonely, and I honestly just hate myself. Everything about myself is awful, I really hate who I am. I became really sick in the first few weeks of school and have had bronchitis for about 3-4 weeks.

I&amp;#39;m looking to get away from pain and if the last minutes of my life could at least be peaceful that would be, well, ideal. I really wish assisted suicide for chronically suicidal people was a thing sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

My parents destroyed my education as an ongoing argument for the funsies I guess. I planned to graduate at 15 or 16 and GTFO. I was physically bullied at school to the point of having my arms near broken every day. I begged to be homeschooled- my plan was to be able to focus on my schooling without bullies and graduate early to get away from my family.

2017 and 2018 sucked. Last year got a little better and by the end of the year I decided to go back to school. I decided rather abruptly and didn't have time to seek diagnosis for learning disabilities, which I think I obviously have. I have a diagnosis of anxiety disorders and recurrent major depressive disorder but I've assumed I wouldn't receive any accommodations for those because.. what can be done?

&amp;nbsp;

Instead I've tried plowing through my feelings and intentionally making myself uncomfortable by joining clubs and going to campus in person, but I'm not adjusting as quickly as I'd hoped. And in the real world, I will have to talk, I will have to have social skills. No one cares about you in the real world. I'm old and have already exposed myself to that in the many job fields I've attempted, so I'm aware. 

&amp;nbsp;

I just feel like I'm a failure. And now I'm overloading myself and I dont want to back down, but idk how to deal with everything and get no help, and have nothing outside of school and working at home. I need a good balance, but I have literally no way of making that happen. I'm in a club that meets once a week, the paper which is 1x a month, and now a new club that no one showed up for, so I became club leader. This will force me into social situations, and I hope that I can do it. In my head I'm telling myself to just do it, so I try, and I talk, and garbage comes out. And I'm older than everyone else, so it's awkward. I'm not supposed to be so immature and stupid by social standards. 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like I'm just not going to make it. I have straight A's but I feel like I don't deserve them. My art never looks good to me even after spending hours working. I need to make this work but I dont know how. I dont know how to change who I've been for 29 years, in an instant, but I desperately want to. I want to be different, I dont want to be who I am anymore. In the meantime, I'm trying to squeeze in time with my SO and getting very little sleep. Most of it is just time in the same room not even interacting or talking or anything and I feel really void of any affection and social interaction right now, as well as anything fun. I used to walk every day- it's something that lessens the frequency of nerve pain and I dont even have time for that. The weather has been shit anyway. I dont find gaming fun, I don't like to sit, but that's all I'm doing. I'm exhausted. 

&amp;nbsp;

I dont even know what I'm getting at anymore with this. I'm just frustrated with life. Everything is dull,I'm over stressed,lonely, and I honestly just hate myself. Everything about myself is awful, I really hate who I am. I became really sick in the first few weeks of school and have had bronchitis for about 3-4 weeks. It's getting better but I feel like that happening really fucked a lot up for me since I had no energy. I dont know how to manage everything or how to socialize. I feel like I should just kill myself but I dont know how to even do it properly in a way that wont be totally awful. I'm looking to get away from pain and if the last minutes of my life could at least be peaceful that would be, well, ideal. I really wish assisted suicide for chronically suicidal people was a thing sometimes.Stress and loneliness are dragging me down again"

I'm 16 years old I left school at 15 quit college at 16 and have no qualifications to rely on. I'm extremely socially awkward and possibly have deppresion I don't know.

Around December last year I took acid for the first time. I don't remember a lot about that night as I entered an incredibly deep bad trip after my friend was kicked out of the house leaving me alone  on my first time. As I said I can't remember a lot about that night but  2 main factors stuck with me 1. My balls felt HEAVY real heavy 2. I thought I killed myself on multiple occasions that night. I kept seeing images of a weapon infront of me each time different each time more deadly. Everyone time believing they were real I tried to use them to end my life. And it felt like I would wake up everytime alive and I would cry. 

Reading back on this probably should have mentioned before I was already suicidal as shit before taking oh well.

Anyway couple months progress I'm doing ok and I'm lying in bed smoking a joint when that sane feeling of heaviness occurred in my balls not as strong this time but still there. After a couple weeks of consistent around night time feelings of heaviness occurred I decided to Google (yeah ik) my issue.

To my absolute fucking horror I discovered I have something called a vardicole or something like that I don't want to go back and check as I'm extremely 0aranoid of reading something I don't want to.

Now before anything gets typed I want to say that it is 100 percent that condition (whatever the name may be) as the symptoms aren't exactly common among other conditions. 

As I said in extremely scared of hospitals and getting examined so something around that area has an extreme effect on me even thinking about getting it checked.

I've been doing good for a while now but I can't get the thoughts out of my head and I can feel myself spiralling until those final moments where I can find eternal peace. 

So this is what I ask of you reading this if you would help me.

,SuicideWatch,"I have nothing but negative thoughts all the time, I can remember when it started but it has gotten so bad I tend to cry myself to sleep if I even can sleep. I don't know who to talk to and don't really have anyone to talk to so I just want to dump everything here and maybe get some guidance before I do something to make the pain go away. I never see my parents due to my mom and step dad being too busy with work and running a business and my dad is probably somewhere rotting in Arizona. My sister is deployed in the navy and the other ran away a few years ago and haven't heard from her, and my older brother is a drug addict that cut ties with us a long time ago. 

I don't want to message a suicide hotline out of fear they will send an ambulance or force me into a hospital forcing bills on me that I can not afford, and I have no one close to talk to about it. My situation is, growing up my parents both lived in different bad areas with little money. I was never smart or talented at anything besides having an over active imagination. I always had a learning issue both with paying attention and remembering information regardless of how hard I tried. Didn't have a lot of friends and ended up dropping out of high school. About 3 years ago I went back and got my Adult Diploma with the hopes it would be enough to get me on my feet. I'm now almost 26 and just a few months ago after I saw someone about my mental health I found out I have ADD. So some things where answered there, but it didn't help much. 

The small amount of friends that I have, have become aware of my increasing depressed emotions and have tried to help but for the most part, they seem to pay no mind to it. I've working dead end jobs for most of my adult life until recently when I took a boot camp course in the Information Technology field. I then interned for 5 weeks and after got a position working for a small company as an IT help desk technician under a 3 month to perm contract. Or that's what they told me during the interview. I never did anything IT related and the contract was constantly extend by 3 months until my 9th month there. In that time, I've worked for some bad companies, but I have never worked somewhere that treated there (specifically the US employees) so poorly. They then after promising to increase my pay hired me on full time as salary, and cut my pay thinking I wouldn't notice. I then secretly started looking for new positions starting last July until November of last year when I was tired of they way they have treated me for over a year and without thinking, just left, even though I have monthly bills. 

On top of the learning problems, I also have extreme anger problems and am very VERY impatient. As far as work goes, I have applied to countless IT positions since last July, with professional help updating resumes and cover letters, and re learning (trying to) as much IT knowledge as I can after using pretty much none of it at my last job and forgetting almost all of it, but I've gotten nothing. I have had 2 companies interview me and reject me after the 2nd or 3rd interview, and all of the other countless companies I've applied to have either flat out rejected me or have not said anything. I have next to nothing left with money and if I don't find something soon, I will lose everything and I can only imagine how bad my credit will be and the law suits to follow. Other than job things, I have never been in a real relationship, I never see my family even though I literally live with my mom and step dad, I almost never see my friends, I have an extreme hate for people I'm assuming due to everything I've had to go through over the years, and every day I spend hours trying to teach myself new things and applying for any position available that could possible help me with my situation, but since the last interview rejection and the constant no reply and email rejections, I can't anymore. 

I've tried so hard to make things better for myself, seeking medical help, close support from family and friends, and will power, but it's always one step forward and then being launched back. I'm tired of starting over, I'm tired of only knowing rejection and being ignored not just from jobs but from everything. I have become so angry and hate filled that I can't see happiness in anything. I used to love movies and video games and can't find joy in those. The only piece of escape I have day to day is music, because it almost thinks for me. I'm listening to it but I feel like it's also listening to me, feeling my constant pain and emotional wreck. Everyone says it will get better, but I've been at this for so long and it only keeps getting worse. I have put the effort in but it's like some deity is purposefully trying to prevent me from being happy or making myself successful, and over the past few weeks, I can't stop thinking of killing myself. Making this awful pain go away and not feeling anything anymore. The only thing that holds me back is the thought of what comes after. Possible non existence which I can't even comprehend. Just not knowing is the only thing holding me back, but even that fear is starting to go away and taking an early exit seems more and more like the best option.

I apologize for the extremely long post, maybe just a way to leave a small mark on existence to make myself feel a little better. I don't seem myself feeling any better even if my hard work eventually gets me anywhere, a family, a job that actually pays enough for me to live on my own, not constantly worrying if I have enough for food and water or if I have to cut that out to make my payments. It's hard to feel happy or accomplished when all you know is failure and loss. There is more but I feel like I've said enough if anyone even reads this.

I feel I can’t even put it into words the emptiness and great suffocation I feel to be alive everyday. Im in community college but I barely go. I work a part time job but I only get one day a week. It’s all so overwhelming. I wanted to be an artist but I can’t even make art anymore, everything feels like such a burden and such a chore in my life. I feel like people don’t care about me at all. I understand they have their own lives, but I feel no one takes what I say seriously. Especially the people I live with, my sister and her wife. They say “we care about you and we understand what you’re feeling but it comes to a point where you have to do things.” Like I understand that, I’m trying, but I just can’t. I’m useless, horrible, and incompetent. 

As a kid, I never really felt happy either. I was always left alone, hated, and ignored. As a kid I was sexually abused for about 2 years by an older girl then 2 random occasions by 2 boys. I’ve suffered from my trauma that didn’t come to surface until I was 16. So I’ve just been dealing with that for a while and I can’t seem to overcome it. I’ve tried a couple medications but they don’t really seem to work. Killing myself seems to be only way to end my pain. I can’t function as a human. I just get so tired, mentally and physically.  I always hope for things to get better but they never do. Im just a fat sack of shit who won’t accomplish anything in their life. I feel I can’t say anything how I truly feel.

I’m trans, gay, a person of color, mentally ill, and I feel like I’m living on borrowed time. My body and head keeps fighting against me as things get externally better, comparatively. I’ve been having blood problems - or maybe just extra health anxiety, I genuinely do not know. Healthcare for trans people is shit. I haven’t had an official doctor, just rotating nurse practitioners from clinics.

When I came out to my grandparents, my grandma said it ran on my mom’s side of the family. Her words were that there “was another [transgender], but he’s dead now”. I don’t know who that is. But he’s dead. And I keep feeling called to be. I get why so many trans activists kill themselves.

,SuicideWatch,"I always liked beauty. Probably the only thing that kept me from ending it all. But even it wasn't enough, isn't, most of the time. 
Sometimes the only thing that calms me is to plan how I'm going to do it. It came to a point that every time that I'm suicidal again the only thing stopping me is the complexity of the scene. I still don't have the right things, I can't go to the place, my hair isn't in the right length and etc. 
I never told anyone about it. I'm living between numbness and intense feelings that hurt too much. I feel like I'm wasting my privileges, I'm wasting my capacities, I don't want to, I don't know what to do. The best phases are when I'm hyper, but I get destructive and it's not ideal.

I'm saving up for a neat looking revolver so I can at least go out with a bang. I just don't know what to put in the text to my mom,I mean how can I just say that I give up, that the world wins, that they were right about meDrafting my note"

,SuicideWatch,"Every morning I wake up, REALLY wishing I didn't wake up. Everyday honestly feels SO difficult to get through to the point where I have almost no energy any longer. I cannot find pleasure in anything and the idea of having to do this any longer really makes me lose it. I am so scared to end my own life because I'm worried it won't work and I'll turn out even worse than I already am.

,SuicideWatch,"I’m having doubts about wanting to keep going. I just turned 25, I’m a girl from the US who is disabled (I have depression, BPD, anxiety, ADD and I have bad tremors as a result of these issues) and my parents treat me like I’m a little girl. I have not worked a proper job very much in my life and I’m a little immature for my age. 

Basically, where I am now, I feel mentally and physically unwell to work - the tremors go in and out and I collapse of exhaustion at least twice a month from them. My parents, my mum especially- are pressuring me to work, she gives me jobs I know I wouldn’t be able to handle and I apply to them to make her happy, though I never hear back. She is a social worker and when I say I’m too unwell to work she goes *”I’ve worked with people with Down’s syndrome, who were severely disabled, they had jobs.”* or *”I worked with a schizophrenic woman once, that’s worse than what you have, and she held down a 9 to 5 job.”* and so fourth. I think I should be on disability but my mum sees that as “giving up” and says that they won’t accept me because I “haven’t showed signs of trying” IE my small work history - the majority of money I’ve made over the years is from my music, but that comes few and far between.
Because I don’t have a job, my mum makes it my “job” in the house to be the only person who ever cleans our cats’ litter box, and when my tremors are going this is bad because I can’t hold the bag straight and I get litter and cat droppings everywhere, but she’s so insistent on sticking it to me that I’m not working that this doesn’t matter. 
I Have two girlfriends, my parents only know I’m dating one of them. One lives in Canada, I have wanted to run away there but my mum said if I even tried to visit her she would get Canadian police to come get me since I’m mentally unwell (my Canadian girlfriend also struggles with that and my parents like her but says she’s a “basket case” and that I shouldn’t  date her) but I  kinda don’t have a passport anyway.

My other girlfriend lives in the Midwest US and my mum says if I moved there I’d never contact the family ever again even though I told her I would, and that I would become ungrateful towards my girlfriend and get an “attitude” with her - my parents say I have a short temper but I’m quite mellow, it’s just that years of verbal abuse from my father - who to his credit is finally doing something about this - has gotten me very damaged.


Anyways, I like tried to stab myself in the stomach but was stopped and the knife was taken from me. I feel  stuck, and I really want to keep going but it’s getting really difficult.

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "HR practitioners and/or hiring managers could have been spending too much time trying to sieve through many resumes for shortlisting suitable candidates whom they can contact for interview.\n",
    "As a job seeker, we may also find ourselves spending so much times looking through plentiful job advertisements which may not be relevant to us.\n",
    "Wouldn't it be nice if pre-selection can be done which will effectively save time for all of us?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Recommender System. Using cosine similarity, to identify similar job seekers / job advertisements.\n",
    "Success will be evaluated based on the top recommendations and its features to see how closely matched are the jobs for the job seekers and vice versa."

    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We scrape the website jobspider.com for resumes. In view that api key is not available, we used BeautifulSoup and regex to get the desired information. As we encounter roadblock on the time connection timeout despite introducing bot agent, we limit the job categories to Accounting and Information Technology for this capstone. \n",
    "For the job ads, we based it on existing dataset that is available on Kaggle which was used for predicting fake job posting since the features in this dataset has 80% simiarity to the resumes dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we were cleaning the resumes dataset,we also decide which features will be important for us to have and which are the one to drop. In view that job title, objective, experience and skills are free texts that hold meaningful words for our analysis, we create a new feature and combine all where we then split the text into words, return them to their root form and also remove the stop words. These are performed for the job ads dataset as well.\n",
    "We use TFidfVectorizer to calculate the weight of the words and not surprisely, words appear in resumes and often found in job ads.\n",
    "\n",
    "For feature selection, we picked `location`, `education level`, `employment type`, `function`, `job level` as our initial criteria. We then put these features through cosine similarity metric, measuring the consine of the angle the features projected in a multi-dimension space to determine their similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noting that our dataset comprises of both job ads and resumes, we then need to slice the dataset together with the similarity scores that showcase resumes on the row index and job ads on the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, we will be able to filter based on resumes returning top similarity scores for job ads and by tranposing the dataset, we then will also be able to get recommendated resumes based on similarity scores against job ads.\n",

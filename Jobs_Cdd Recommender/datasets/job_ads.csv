Attention to detail and a curiosity to jump into our development process is a must.ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONWhat will you work on? Rippleshot uses Machine Learning and Big Data to analyze credit card transactions in ways that haven't been possible before. Millions of records are processed per day and loaded into a hadoop cluster. From there, the machine learning algorithm will compare that data with verified fraud to identify merchants that may have suffered a data breach earlier than current manual methods. This data is loaded into a Ruby on Rails platform which acts as an AJAX back-end for the Javascript data visualization front end. This JS front-end uses AngularJS and D3 to make it even easier for users to see data breaches as quickly as they are detected.ABOUT USIn our 15 years of experience identifying and mitigating card fraud, weâve seen the problem grow from a transaction-level headache to a commerce-threatening phenomenon. In 2012 the founders came together to change the fight against fraud by creating Rippleshot.We take a big data machine learning approach that is familiar to search, genetics and advertising and apply it in a novel way for the payment processing industry. We focus on merchant instead of consumer behavior. We monitor millions of merchants and their transactions, searching through the data for subtle behavioral patterns that indicate the early stages of a breach. We use sophisticated statistics and modeling to distinguish between real breaches and nearby stores that share many of the same patrons, resulting in very accurate assessments.","QUALIFICATIONSJavascript Developers at Rippleshot will work with AngularJS, D3, Crossfilter and Ruby on Rails to create dynamic single page applications to visualize credit card fraud.

819,Senior iOS Developer,TX,Texas,,,,"ABOUT our beloved company, BOTTLE ROCKET:Bottle Rocket is dedicated to creating the highest quality iPhone, iPad and Android applications and brand-critical mobile solutions on the planet. We believe exceptionally innovative technology not only enhances the way we do thingsâit redefines the way we live our lives. To us, iOS and Android are more than sophisticated mobile operating systemsâthey are game-changing platforms uniting information, instant access and unlimited range to create entertainment and enterprise solutions.We are a rapidly growing mobile strategy, design and development company at the forefront of the app revolution. We literally started the morning after Steve Jobsâ keynote announcing the iPhone SDK and months before the Apple App Store was even launched. In that time we have grown to a team of over 180 smart, passionate, hard-working Rocketeers and released over 150 high-profile, premium brand-critical mobile experiences for companies like History Channel, American Express, Discovery, ESPN, LEGO, Food Network, WWE, PBS, National Geographic, Coke, NBC Universal, NPR, Chick-fil-A and Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts, as well extremely popular games such as Rockpocalypse and Annoying Orange: Kitchen Carnage. Our apps have been Emmy nominated, won multiple Tabby, Webby and Media Vanguard Awards, are regularly featured in the press and have been awarded more Apple Hall of Fame Awards than any other company. Our work is used by tens of millions of delighted users every day to connect with the information, brands and entertainment they love. But this is just the tip of the iceberg.Â Now, letâs talk ABOUT what itâs like to have a career at BOTTLE ROCKET:We will never stop pushing the envelope of design, architecture and the capabilities of the platforms we embrace. Our future promises continued growth of both our capacity and capabilities in all areas of our business from strategy, creative, engineering, quality assurance, project management, account management and administration and across our core custom design and development divisions (if you can dream it, we can build it) as well our specialty divisions focusing on game development, TV Everywhere, enterprise, commerce, publishing and more. If you choose to get to know Bottle Rocket better, youâll learn that we are a values-driven business where things like âembrace the impossibleâ, âtake your craft personallyâ and âserve the userâ really mean something. If you visit our studio the first thing youâll feel is passion. The next is energy and excitement. Youâll see Rocketeers debating design issues at whiteboards on nearly every wall, focusing on tough problems in complex code, leading client meetings with the worldâs top brands, conducting user testing to find areas to improve our work and creating project plans to release the next award-winning app. Youâll see a 100% Mac laptop environment (either 15â MacBook Pro Retina or 13â Mac Air), electric height-adjustable desks on wheels, seriously robust Wi-Fi, hundreds of test devices available for checkout, bean bags, booths and 27â Apple Cinema Displays on every desk.With all of this comes another big challenge, embracing the impossible.

In the process of learning about our clients, we also learned a lot about ourselves, but weâll get to that shortlyIn working with our clients on their businesses, we found certain obstacles. To grow, focus needed to be kept on processes and not infrastructure.

The more time we spent on simplifying the process of doing business, the more we realized technology was the biggest hurdle. The more we made recommendations on technology, the more we realized we needed to be the source of the technology we recommended and implemented.It wasnât long before we realized our true calling. We took a hard look at what we were doing and what was most effective for our clients. Creating, managing, and implementing technology solutions would be far more valuable to our clients.We still continue to evolve and grow, and we always have our clientsâ best interest in mind. Whether itâs a home user or a company with hundreds of users, we want to make sure the use of their Macs is productive, effective, and as easy as possible.With all of the web sites and big box stores, weâre happy to be a small, independently owned business with the one main goal in mind â you and your Mac.","Create More is anÂ Independently owned Apple Specialist store in the heart of San Francisco.

8435,Full Stack Developer (Mid Level),CO,Colorado,,,,"What we are doing:Talent Standard is bringing adaptive learning to corporate training resulting in faster and more effective learning for everyone. Our first product is applying adaptive learning to complex financial model training and targets teams in banking and finance. Long term we are helping companies adapt to a world where brilliant people donât need credentials. We enable brilliant people, regardless of their background, by delivering relevant high quality knowledge connected to the challenges they are facing.How adaptive learning works:Adaptive learning works by clustering experience data to (1) develop knowledge curves (e.g. beginning vs. advanced) and (2) determine the strength of relationships between concepts (e.g. to know âBâ you have to know âAâ first). Using this analysis we are able to very effectively assess what a person does not know and present personalized training to fill in those gaps.Who we are:At our core we are scientists learning about people and knowledge through observation in order to add value to the lives of others. We are democratizing business knowledge because our hypothesis is that given the necessary knowledge and skill, a personâs potential is unlimited. Proving this hypothesis requires remarkable results.To achieve remarkable results we think big, but build simple. Our incremental goals are big enough to matter, but small enough to achieve. Changing the world doesn't happen overnight, and we are in this for the long haul. There will be challenges, and we transparently embrace them with grit and resilience. We greatly value diversity and diverse opinions and believe honest and thoughtful debate make us stronger.The founder has deep experience in the banking industry and consulting on significant internal software development efforts, and analytics for large data sets. Most recently at a multinational bank he led a four person cross functional team who prepared a portion of the bankâs Federal Reserve Stress Test reporting. Despite being known as very intense, he has an intense love of LOLCats.The technical adviser has extensive experience in software development. He was previously the cofounder and CTO of a successful technology startup, and is currently a software development manager at Amazon. He has a keen sense of humor and a love of puns.The board of directors has broad subject matter expertise and experience in higher education, accounting, finance, and law.","What we are looking for: We are seeking an experienced mid-level developer generalist to develop the full-stack (front-end + middleware including API integration + data layer) of our first product iteration. You will work with general direction from our technical adviser and day to day interaction with our founder.To be considered for this role you must have experience with Python, Django, and developing for an API. For this level role it is expected that you have prior experience developing functional web apps from the ground up, applying Bootstrap or other UI frameworks, and using appropriate versioning, testing, and security practices, but it is not necessary to have a large portfolio of applications you developed. We have a strong preference for someone with applied or academic experience working with large data sets, analytics, and continuous integration.To be successful here you must be intellectually curious, have a burning passion for changing the world, a hands-on/get sh*t done attitude, exceptional communications , and irreproachable integrity.

    "HR practitioners and/or hiring managers could have been spending too much time trying to sieve through many resumes for shortlisting suitable candidates whom they can contact for interview.\n",
    "As a job seeker, we may also find ourselves spending so much times looking through plentiful job advertisements which may not be relevant to us.\n",

    "We scrape the website spiderjob.com for resumes. In view that api key is not available, we used BeautifulSoup and regex to get the desired information. As we encounter roadblock on the time connection timeout despite introducing bot agent, we limit the job categories to Accounting and Information Technology for this capstone. \n",
    "For the job ads, we based it on existing dataset that is available on Kaggle which was used for predicting fake job posting since the features in this dataset has 80% simiarity to the resumes dataset.\n",

    "As we were cleaning the resumes dataset, we at the same made decision which features will be important for us to have and which are the one to drop. In view that job title, objective, experience and skills are free texts that hold meaningful words for our analysis, we create a new feature and combine all where we then split the text into words, return them to their root form and also remove the stop words. These are performed for the job ads dataset.\n",

Our products can be used in petroleum, chemical, pharmaceutical, machinery, decoration, construction, engineering, shipbuilding, food and other industries.As a professional stainless steel manufacturer, we also have a variety of Stainless Steel Decorative Sheet for sale. Our Mirror Stainless Steel Sheet is 8K sheet, also called mirror sheet. The surface of the stainless steel plate was polished using a polishing liquid by a polishing apparatus. The 8K mirror panel is corrosion resistant, and the mirror panel can also be processed by plating and etching. It is mainly used for various types of decorative or metal optical products.Brushing refers to the striped texture effect on the surface of stainless steel, which is the most common and widely used surface treatment technology. After brushing the frosted surface of the stainless steel plate, the surface is textured, but without unevenness. It has better performance than ordinary 2B stainless steel surface, because the surface wire drawing treatment can reflect the texture of metal materials. Compared with other textures, the scratches on the surface of the random pattern Brushed Stainless Steel Sheet are easier to repair.

       "  'objective': ['Objective:Computers don\\'t always work as they should. Components fail, and operating systems fill up with crap that hinders performance and occasionally brings the whole machine to a halt. Savvy users know that they can fix most PC problems themselves, and use sites like www.techrepairsonline.com to find solutions to their tech problems. Those who lack confidence in their tech skills, however, often fall prey to the rapacious tactics of online and local repair shops. Lest your local geeks-for-hire take you for a ride (or fleece someone you love), we\\'ve rounded up a representative sampling of typical repair-shop services to help you sort the rip-offs from the reasonable deals.In this article, I\\'ll explore some of the most common offerings you\\'ll find at repair shops large and small. These aren\\'t scams, to be sure--as far as we know, these are all legitimate services from legitimate businesses. But the actual value of these services--relative to the work involved and the likely benefit to the consumer--can be highly questionable in many cases.PC Tune-Ups:Just about every repair shop I\\'ve encountered offers some kind of \"tune-up\" service that promises to improve your PC\\'s performance by deleting temporary files, defragmenting your hard drive, removing unused applications, running Windows Update, and (in many cases) cleaning the Windows Registry. These services often cost $50 to $100, but generally they don\\'t do anything useful that you couldn\\'t do yourself with a free download and some utilities that come with your PC.Before you shell out a hundred bucks, think about what this service entails: Windows comes with a utility called Disk Cleanup that will delete temporary files for you with a few measly mouse clicks. Disk Defragmenter--another built-in Windows tool--typically runs automatically on a weekly basis, but you can launch it yourself by going to Accessories, Utilities and clicking Defragment Disk. Windows Update also runs automatically by default, but you can click Start, type Windows Update in the search field, and run it yourself on command.If you have a bunch of programs you don\\'t use, launch the \\'Programs and Features\\' utility from the Control Panel and weed them out by clicking on them and selecting Uninstall from the menu above the main window. Or download RevoUninstaller, a proven freebie that does a bang-up job of pulling out all the detritus that Windows\\' uninstaller often leaves behind.As for Registry cleaners, we recommend avoiding them entirely. Although the premise that removing unneeded Registry entries can speed up your PC is basically sound, there\\'s little evidence that it works in practice, and you can easily do more harm than good when you go mucking about in the Registry.Not counting the time you\\'ll spend waiting for Disk Defragmenter and Windows Update to automatically do their thing, the total amount of time a relative novice should take to perform all these tune-up tasks is about 15 minutes. So save your money, and check out www.techrepairsonline.com, the best site on the internet to guide you and help to giveYOUR computer a performance boost without paying for dubious services.

Along with my solid academic background, I have gained exceptional hands on experience into the various aspects of the accounting profession. Assignments in my career consisted of intercompany accounting, preparing and posting month end financial close entries, full range general accounting duties, bank reconciliation, intercompany account reconciliation, balance sheet reconciliation, royalty and commission payment calculation, assisting budget process, analyze and explain monthly variances, preparing tax returns and various reports that must be filed with the SEC, performing audits and various other assignments.My first full time accounting position was with MAP services, which is the management office to 4 restaurant establishments. Major accomplishments included, working directly with the CFO to streamline the accounting process; and convert from Excel based accounting to MAS 90 accounting program. At Prudential Financial I managed 7 Mutual Funds. Responsibilities included performing the majority of the fund’s asset valuation and preparing all tax returns. Fund Accounting taught me great time management and multitasking skills. At Wyndham Worldwide I managed a newly acquired resort. Accordingly, I built the work papers from the bottom up. I converted accounting information from the previously used program to the PeopleSoft program we used. I performed the entire gamut of general accounting and reporting for all transactions that were processed.I enjoyed the exciting environment at A&E Television Networks. I identified reasons why royalty reporting was time consuming, and implemented ways to eliminate some of the process in order to be more efficient. I performed the full gamut of general accounting duties for A&E’s Consumer Products division. A&E acquired Life Time Television at the end of 2009, which ultimately resulted in corporate down size.I am diligent, highly organized, and responsible. Over the years I have developed into a commendable professional. I know the importance of effective communication and multitasking skills, as well as adhering to deadlines. I am confident that I would be an asset to your organization, in helping to meet its goals.I would welcome the opportunity to discuss an accounting position with you in person.
